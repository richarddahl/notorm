# Phase 2 Implementation Plan: Domain Framework

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for Phase 2 of our architecture modernization: the Domain Framework. Building on the core infrastructure established in Phase 1, Phase 2 focuses on creating a comprehensive domain modeling framework based on Domain-Driven Design principles.

## Overview

Phase 2 will implement the building blocks for domain modeling, including Entity base classes, Value Objects, Aggregates, Specifications, Domain Events, and Repository implementations. These components will provide the foundation for building rich domain models that capture business rules and ensure consistency.

## 1. Entity Framework

### Entity Base Class

The Entity base class will provide the core functionality for all domain entities:

- Identity management with type-safe IDs
- Created/updated timestamp tracking
- Equality by identity
- Change tracking
- Validation hooks
- Serialization support

Implementation:
- Create `EntityBase[ID_TYPE]` class in `uno/domain/entity.py`
- Implement equality and hashing by ID
- Add created_at and updated_at tracking
- Add change tracking mechanisms

### AggregateRoot Class

Building on the Entity base class, the AggregateRoot will serve as the entry point to aggregates:

- Event collection and management
- Invariant validation
- Optimistic concurrency with versioning
- Strict encapsulation of aggregate internals

Implementation:
- Create `AggregateRoot[ID_TYPE]` class in `uno/domain/aggregate.py` extending EntityBase
- Implement event collection with add_event/clear_events
- Add version property for optimistic concurrency
- Implement invariant validation hooks

## 2. Value Objects

Value objects are immutable objects that describe aspects of the domain without identity:

- Immutability by design
- Equality by attributes
- Self-validation
- Domain-specific operations

Implementation:
- Create `ValueObject` base class in `uno/domain/value_object.py`
- Implement immutability with frozen dataclasses or Pydantic
- Implement equality by attribute
- Add domain validation support
- Create specialized value object types (Money, Email, Address, etc.)

## 3. Specification Pattern

The Specification pattern will provide a way to encapsulate query criteria:

- Base Specification pattern
- Composite specifications (And, Or, Not)
- Translation to different query languages

Implementation:
- Create `Specification[T]` protocol in `uno/domain/specification.py`
- Implement CompositeSpecification with And, Or, Not operations
- Create SqlSpecificationTranslator for converting to SQL expressions
- Add support for building predicates for in-memory filtering

## 4. Repository Pattern

Building on the foundation from Phase 1, extend the repository pattern:

- Specification-based querying
- Identity mapping for aggregates
- Optimistic concurrency support
- Transaction support with Unit of Work (from Phase 1)

Implementation:
- Create `EntityRepository[T, ID]` in `uno/domain/repositories/entity_repository.py`
- Implement `SpecificationRepository[T, ID]` for specification-based querying
- Create concrete implementations for SQLAlchemy and in-memory storage
- Integrate with Unit of Work from Phase 1

## 5. Domain Events

Extend the event system from Phase 1 with domain-specific features:

- Aggregate-based event collection
- Domain-specific event metadata
- Event sourcing support (basic)

Implementation:
- Create `DomainEvent` in `uno/domain/events.py` extending the Event class from Phase 1
- Implement event serialization for persistence
- Add event correlation and causation ID support
- Create EventSource repository for event sourcing capabilities

## 6. Domain Services

Domain services capture domain operations that don't naturally belong to entities:

- Base DomainService class
- Integration with repositories
- Domain event publication

Implementation:
- Create `DomainService` interface in `uno/domain/service.py`
- Implement BaseDomainService with common functionality
- Add specialized service types for different patterns

## Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Entity Framework and Value Objects

**Day 1-2: Entity Base Classes**
- [ ] Create EntityBase with ID management and equality
- [ ] Implement change tracking and timestamps
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests for EntityBase
- [ ] Create AggregateRoot with event tracking
- [ ] Implement versioning and invariant validation

**Day 3-4: Value Objects**
- [ ] Create ValueObject base class
- [ ] Implement equality and immutability
- [ ] Add validation hooks
- [ ] Create specialized value objects
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests

**Day 5: Integration**
- [ ] Ensure Entity and ValueObject interoperability
- [ ] Create examples and documentation
- [ ] Verify compatibility with Phase 1 components

### Week 2: Specifications, Repositories, and Domain Events

**Day 1-2: Specification Pattern**
- [ ] Implement Specification protocol
- [ ] Create composite specifications
- [ ] Build specification translators
- [ ] Write tests for specifications

**Day 3-4: Repository Implementations**
- [ ] Implement EntityRepository
- [ ] Create SpecificationRepository
- [ ] Build concrete implementations
- [ ] Integrate with Unit of Work
- [ ] Write repository tests

**Day 5: Domain Events**
- [ ] Enhance Event class for domain needs
- [ ] Implement event publishing in AggregateRoot
- [ ] Create event sourcing foundations
- [ ] Test event propagation

## Completion Criteria

Phase 2 will be considered complete when:

1. All components have been implemented and tested
2. Documentation has been updated
3. Example implementations have been created
4. Legacy code has been marked for deprecation
5. Integration tests pass, showing all components working together
6. A simple domain model can be created using the new framework

## Dependencies

- Phase 1 core infrastructure (completed)
- EventBus implementation (completed)
- Unit of Work pattern (completed)

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **Risk**: Over-engineering the domain framework
   **Mitigation**: Focus on essential patterns first, add complexity incrementally

2. **Risk**: Performance overhead of rich domain model
   **Mitigation**: Implement benchmarks, optimize critical paths

3. **Risk**: Backward compatibility challenges
   **Mitigation**: Provide clean migration paths, maintain compatibility layers

## Next Steps After Phase 2

After completing Phase 2, we will proceed to Phase 3: API Integration, which will focus on connecting the domain model to the API layer using a consistent endpoint pattern.
