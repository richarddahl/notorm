# Uno Framework Modernization Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the key improvements planned for the Uno framework to make it more modular, loosely coupled, and aligned with modern Python best practices.

## Phase 1: Core Architecture Improvements

### 1. Complete Protocol-Based Design
- [x] Implement core dependency injection system with protocols
- [x] Replace concrete class dependencies with protocol interfaces throughout
- [x] Add proper generic type constraints to all protocols
- [x] Create a protocol validation system

### 2. Domain-Driven Design Architecture
- [x] Reorganize code into bounded contexts/domains
- [x] Define aggregate roots, entities, value objects, and domain services
- [x] Separate domain logic from infrastructure concerns
- [x] Implement repository pattern consistently

### 3. Event-Driven Architecture
- [x] Implement robust event bus system with topic-based routing
- [x] Create domain event base classes and interfaces
- [x] Support both sync and async event handlers
- [x] Add event persistence for reliable processing

## Phase 2: Performance and Scalability

### 4. CQRS Pattern Implementation
- [ ] Separate command (write) and query (read) models
- [ ] Create specialized command handlers
- [ ] Implement optimized query handlers
- [ ] Add command/query validation

### 5. Async-First Architecture
- [ ] Convert remaining synchronous code to async
- [ ] Use async context managers throughout
- [ ] Implement proper cancellation handling
- [ ] Add task management utilities

### 6. Resource Management
- [ ] Implement connection pooling with configurable limits
- [ ] Add proper resource cleanup through context managers
- [ ] Use structured concurrency patterns
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker pattern for external services

### 7. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Add query result caching layer
- [ ] Implement dataloader pattern for efficient batch loading
- [ ] Use connection streaming for large results
- [ ] Add query optimization hints

## Phase 3: Developer Experience and Quality

### 8. Error Handling Framework
- [ ] Create a comprehensive error hierarchy
- [ ] Implement result objects (Either pattern)
- [ ] Add structured logging with contextual information
- [ ] Create error catalog for consistent error codes

### 9. Testing Framework
- [ ] Implement property-based testing for complex operations
- [ ] Add integration test harness with containerized dependencies
- [ ] Create snapshot testing for complex objects
- [ ] Add performance regression tests

### 10. Configuration Management
- [ ] Implement environment-specific configuration profiles
- [ ] Add validation for configuration values
- [ ] Support hot reloading of configuration
- [ ] Create configuration schema documentation

## Phase 4: Extensibility and Maintenance

### 11. Plugin Architecture
- [ ] Create plugin system for extending functionality
- [ ] Enable hot-swapping of implementations
- [ ] Support dynamic service registration
- [ ] Add plugin discovery mechanism

### 12. API Versioning and Evolution
- [ ] Add proper API versioning strategy
- [ ] Implement backwards-compatible interfaces
- [ ] Create deprecation paths for evolving APIs
- [ ] Add API documentation generation

### 13. Monitoring and Observability
- [ ] Add comprehensive metrics collection
- [ ] Implement distributed tracing
- [ ] Create health check endpoints
- [ ] Add performance dashboard

### 14. Modern Packaging
- [ ] Move to pyproject.toml-only configuration
- [ ] Add proper optional dependency groups
- [ ] Implement semantic versioning
- [ ] Create CI/CD pipeline for releases

### 15. Documentation Generation
- [ ] Auto-generate API documentation from code
- [ ] Create interactive examples
- [ ] Document architectural decisions
- [ ] Add migration guides for breaking changes
