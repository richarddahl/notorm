# Uno Framework Modernization Roadmap (April 2025 Update)

This roadmap outlines the key improvements planned for the Uno framework to make it more modular, loosely coupled, and aligned with modern Python best practices. Items marked with [x] have been completed.

## Phase 1: Core Architecture Improvements (✅ Completed)

### 1. Complete Protocol-Based Design
- [x] Implement core dependency injection system with protocols
- [x] Replace concrete class dependencies with protocol interfaces throughout
- [x] Add proper generic type constraints to all protocols
- [x] Create a protocol validation system

### 2. Domain-Driven Design Architecture
- [x] Reorganize code into bounded contexts/domains
- [x] Define aggregate roots, entities, value objects, and domain services
- [x] Separate domain logic from infrastructure concerns
- [x] Implement repository pattern consistently

### 3. Event-Driven Architecture
- [x] Implement robust event bus system with topic-based routing
- [x] Create domain event base classes and interfaces
- [x] Support both sync and async event handlers
- [x] Add event persistence for reliable processing

## Phase 2: Performance and Scalability (In Progress)

### 4. CQRS Pattern Implementation (✅ Completed)
- [x] Separate command (write) and query (read) models
- [x] Create specialized command handlers
- [x] Implement optimized query handlers
- [x] Add command/query validation

### 5. Read Model Projections (✅ Completed)
- [x] Create specialized read models for efficient querying
- [x] Implement projection system for maintaining read models
- [x] Add event handlers to update projections
- [x] Optimize read models for specific query patterns

### 6. Async-First Architecture (✅ Completed)
- [x] Convert remaining synchronous code to async
- [x] Implement proper cancellation handling
- [x] Add enhanced concurrency primitives
- [x] Create task management utilities
- [x] Implement structured concurrency patterns
- [x] Add async resource management

### 7. Resource Management
