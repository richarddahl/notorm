# Documentation Development Plan

This document outlines a systematic plan for ongoing development and improvement of uno documentation. It establishes priorities, processes, and timelines to ensure that documentation remains accurate, comprehensive, and useful. For a visual representation of current documentation status and priorities, see [DOCUMENTATION_STATUS_VISUALIZATION.md](./DOCUMENTATION_STATUS_VISUALIZATION.md).

## Documentation Objectives

1. **Completeness**: Ensure all components, features, and APIs are fully documented

   - Implementation timeline: Week 4-5

## Maintenance and Review Cycles

### Regular Documentation Reviews

1. **Weekly Documentation Audits**
   - Automated checks for broken links
   - Verify new documentation meets standards
   - Quick review of recently changed documentation

2. **Monthly Documentation Sprints**
   - Dedicate 1-2 days per month to documentation improvements
   - Focus on highest priority areas
   - Address issues identified in weekly audits

3. **Quarterly Comprehensive Reviews**
   - Deep review of all documentation
   - Cross-reference with code changes
   - Update examples to reflect best practices
   - Validate accuracy of all technical information

### Documentation in Development Process

1. **Feature Development Integration**
   - Every new feature requires documentation
   - Documentation review is part of PR process
   - Implement "docs or it didn't happen" policy

2. **API Change Management**
   - When APIs change, documentation must be updated
   - Deprecation notices must include migration guidance
   - Version documentation to match code versions

3. **User Feedback Loop**
   - Create a streamlined way for users to report documentation issues
   - Track documentation-related questions in support channels
   - Prioritize improvements based on user confusion points

## Conclusion

This documentation development plan provides a structured approach to systematically improve uno documentation. By prioritizing critical missing documentation, implementing process improvements, and establishing regular review cycles, we can ensure that the documentation becomes and remains a key strength of the framework.

This plan should be reviewed and updated every three months to ensure it continues to address the most pressing documentation needs and aligns with the broader project roadmap.
