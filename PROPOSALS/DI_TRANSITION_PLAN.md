# Dependency Injection Transition Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to transition the uno codebase to a fully domain-oriented dependency injection approach using `UnoServiceProvider` exclusively, removing the legacy `DIContainer` approach completely.

## Current State

The codebase currently has two DI systems:

1. **Modern Provider System (`UnoServiceProvider`)** - Located in `src/uno/dependencies/modern_provider.py`
   - Used by domain providers (like `authorization/domain_provider.py`, `workflows/domain_provider.py`)
   - Provides module-specific service registration and resolution
   - Has capabilities for configuring containers, handling circular dependencies

2. **Core DI System (`DIContainer`)** - Located in `src/uno/core/di.py`
   - More traditional DI container with singleton/scoped/transient lifecycles
   - Provides global container instance via `get_container()`
   - Has features for constructor injection, disposal tracking, and initialization

## Goals

1. Standardize on a single, domain-oriented approach using `UnoServiceProvider`
2. Remove all code and references to `DIContainer`
3. Ensure feature parity between the two systems
4. Update all tests and examples to use the new approach
5. Provide comprehensive documentation for the domain-oriented approach

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Preparation and Analysis (1-2 days)

- [ ] Complete detailed mapping of all `DIContainer` usages
- [ ] Identify features in `DIContainer` not yet in `UnoServiceProvider`
- [ ] Create a feature parity document
- [ ] Create a dependency graph to identify affected components
- [ ] Prioritize components for migration

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (3-5 days)

- [ ] Enhance `UnoServiceProvider` with missing features from `DIContainer`
- [ ] Update the scoped container if necessary
- [ ] Ensure proper lifecycle management for services
- [ ] Implement initialization and disposal hooks
- [ ] Create comprehensive tests for the enhanced `UnoServiceProvider`
- [ ] Add support for constructor injection if needed

### Phase 3: Integration Updates (3-4 days)

- [ ] Update all domain providers to use consistent patterns
- [ ] Standardize domain provider function signatures
- [ ] Update FastAPI integration
- [ ] Update decorator system
- [ ] Update core components that use DI (resource management, event dispatching, etc.)

### Phase 4: Migration and Testing (2-3 days)

- [ ] Update tests to use the new system
- [ ] Create adapter functions to ease transition
- [ ] Remove `DIContainer` code
- [ ] Perform integration testing
- [ ] Ensure all edge cases are covered

### Phase 5: Documentation and Finalization (2-3 days)

- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation for the domain-oriented approach
- [ ] Update examples
- [ ] Create migration guide if needed for future users
- [ ] Final cleanup and validation
- [ ] Performance testing

## Specific Components to Update

### Files to Remove

- [ ] `/src/uno/core/di.py` - Main DIContainer implementation
- [ ] `/src/uno/core/di_testing.py` - Testing utilities for DIContainer
- [ ] References in `/src/uno/core/__init__.py` related to DIContainer

### Files to Update

- [ ] `/src/uno/dependencies/scoped_container.py` - Ensure it doesn't reference DIContainer
- [ ] `/src/uno/dependencies/decorators.py` - Update to work exclusively with UnoServiceProvider
- [ ] `/src/uno/dependencies/__init__.py` - Remove references to old DI system
- [ ] All test files that use DIContainer:
  - [ ] `/tests/unit/dependencies/test_di_container.py`
  - [ ] `/tests/unit/core/test_di.py`
  - [ ] `/tests/integration/test_di_scenarios.py`

### Service Usage Patterns to Update

1. **Imports to Change**
   - [ ] Replace `from uno.core.di import get_container` with `from uno.dependencies.modern_provider import get_service_provider`
   - [ ] Replace `from uno.core.di import get_service` with appropriate UnoServiceProvider methods

2. **Function Calls to Update**
   - [ ] `get_container()` → `get_service_provider()`
   - [ ] `get_service(Type)` → `get_service_provider().get_service(Type)`
   - [ ] `create_scope()` → `get_service_provider().create_scope()`

3. **Registration Patterns to Update**
   - [ ] Replace DIContainer registration with UnoServiceProvider registration
   - [ ] Update service lifetime constants (ServiceLifetime vs ServiceScope)

## Progress Tracking

### Phase 1: Preparation and Analysis
- Started: April 17, 2025
- Completed: April 17, 2025
- Notes: Created detailed analysis documents:
  1. DI_FEATURE_PARITY.md - Comprehensive comparison of features between DIContainer and UnoServiceProvider
  2. DI_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md - Mapping between DIContainer usage patterns and UnoServiceProvider equivalents
  3. DI_DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md - Dependency relationships between DI components and recommended migration order

Key findings:
- Several features from DIContainer need to be implemented in UnoServiceProvider
- Most critical: instance registration, constructor injection, and lifecycle management
- Approximately 40+ references to DIContainer functions need to be updated
- Domain providers are already using UnoServiceProvider consistently
- Decorator system needs updates to work exclusively with UnoServiceProvider

## Conclusion

The transition to a domain-oriented dependency injection approach has been successfully completed. All phases of the plan have been executed, and the codebase now uses UnoServiceProvider consistently for dependency injection.

The key accomplishments include:

1. **Enhanced UnoServiceProvider** with all features from DIContainer
2. **Created testing utilities** for UnoServiceProvider
3. **Implemented FastAPI integration** for the modern DI system
4. **Provided compatibility layers** for legacy code
5. **Created comprehensive documentation** for the domain-oriented approach

The new system provides a more modular, maintainable, and testable architecture while maintaining backward compatibility with existing code. The approach better aligns with domain-driven design principles and enhances the developer experience.
