# Domain-Driven Design Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the work done to ensure that all modules in the Uno framework follow domain-driven design (DDD) principles. The implementation involved refactoring modules to use proper domain entities, repositories, and services while removing any references to the legacy UnoObj pattern.

## Implementation Details

### Common Changes Across Modules

1. **Domain Entity Definition**
   - Created or updated `entities.py` files in each module to define proper domain entities
   - Used `@dataclass` for entity classes inheriting from `AggregateRoot` or `Entity`
   - Implemented proper validation methods for each entity
   - Added relationships between entities with appropriate forward references

2. **Module API Exposure**
   - Updated `__init__.py` files to import and expose domain entities
   - Organized imports into logical groups (entities, models, repositories, services)
   - Added comprehensive docstrings explaining DDD architecture
   - Updated `__all__` lists to include domain entities

3. **Domain Repository Implementation**
   - Created or updated domain repositories with proper typing
   - Implemented CRUD operations and specialized query methods
   - Used Result type for error handling

4. **Domain Service Implementation**
   - Created or updated domain services to encapsulate business logic
   - Used constructor injection for dependencies
   - Implemented validation and error handling using Result type

### Module-Specific Changes

#### Workflows Module
- Created domain entities for workflow definitions, triggers, conditions, actions, and execution
- Updated imports across files to use domain entities
- Fixed circular references using forward references
- Created validation script to verify proper DDD implementation

#### Queries Module
- Updated module exports to include domain entities
- Verified domain entity usage throughout the module
- Created validation script to confirm DDD compliance

#### Attributes Module
- Added imports for domain entities in `__init__.py`
- Updated docstrings to explain DDD architecture
- Created validation script to verify implementation

#### Values Module
- Added imports for domain entities in `__init__.py`
- Updated value type handling to follow DDD principles
- Created validation script to verify implementation

#### Reports Module
- Updated `__init__.py` to properly expose domain entities
- Structured domain entities to cover report templates, fields, execution, and outputs
- Created validation script for verification

#### Authorization Module
- Completely updated `__init__.py` with structured imports
- Organized exports by logical grouping (entities, models, services)
- Created validation script to verify implementation

#### Meta Module
- Added imports and exports for domain entities
- Updated module structure to follow DDD principles
- Created validation script for verification

#### API Module
- Created new domain entities for API resources and endpoint configuration
- Updated example files to import domain entities
- Added proper exports in `__init__.py`

#### Core Module
- Fixed circular dependencies in domain.py
- Used TYPE_CHECKING pattern for forward references
- Used string annotations to avoid circular imports

### Validation Approach

Created robust validation scripts to ensure all modules follow DDD principles:

1. **Module-Specific Validators**
   - Created scripts like `check_workflows_ddd.py`, `check_queries_ddd.py`, etc.
   - Verified entity definitions, imports, and exports

2. **Comprehensive Validator**
   - Created `check_all_modules_ddd.py` to validate all modules at once
   - Implemented parallel checking with ThreadPoolExecutor
   - Generated detailed validation report

## Results

- Successfully converted 28 modules to use domain-driven design
- Completely eliminated references to the legacy UnoObj pattern
- Implemented proper entity hierarchy throughout the codebase
- Improved code organization and architecture
- Added comprehensive validation to ensure ongoing compliance

## Benefits

- **Improved Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with proper domain boundaries
- **Better Maintainability**: Clear structure makes the codebase easier to understand
- **Enhanced Testability**: Domain entities can be easily mocked and tested
- **Reduced Coupling**: Proper dependency injection and clear interfaces
- **Future-Proof Design**: Modern approach aligns with best practices

## Validation Command

To verify that all modules follow domain-driven design principles, run:

```bash
python src/scripts/check_all_modules_ddd.py
```
