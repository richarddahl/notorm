# Future Enhancement Proposals

This document outlines potential future enhancements for uno, providing a roadmap for capabilities that could make uno even more powerful and developer-friendly.

## GraphQL Integration

### Overview
Implementing GraphQL support would provide developers with more flexible querying capabilities, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data while simplifying front-end development.

### Implementation Plan

1. **Core Components**
   - GraphQL schema generator based on UnoObj definitions
   - Query resolvers that leverage existing UnoObj filtering capabilities
   - Mutation resolvers mapped to existing service methods
   - Subscription support for real-time updates

2. **Integration Strategy**
   - Create a GraphQLRouter similar to the existing REST Routers
   - Implement automatic schema generation from UnoObj models
   - Add GraphQL-specific query resolvers that leverage the existing filter_manager
   - Map mutations to existing service methods to maintain DRY principles
   - Support subscriptions through the existing events system

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Provide decorators for custom resolvers and field definitions
   - Automatic documentation generation through GraphiQL/GraphQL Playground
   - Type-safe schema generation leveraging Python type hints

4. **Performance Considerations**
   - Implement DataLoader pattern for batching database queries
   - Cache GraphQL query results using existing caching mechanisms
   - Support query complexity analysis to prevent resource-intensive queries

5. **Security**
   - Leverage existing authentication and authorization mechanisms
   - Implement depth and complexity limits to prevent abuse
   - Field-level permissions based on existing authorization rules

### Dependencies
- Either Strawberry, Ariadne, or Graphene (evaluate based on type safety and compatibility)
- DataLoader implementation (can leverage existing `uno.core.dataloader`)

### Timeline Estimate
- Research and design: 2 weeks
- Core implementation: 3-4 weeks
- Testing and documentation: 2 weeks
- Performance optimization: 1-2 weeks

## Additional Enhancement Proposals

### Real-time Collaboration
Implement real-time collaboration features for multi-user applications:
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates
- Operational transformation for conflict resolution
- Presence indicators and activity tracking

### Mobile App SDK
Create SDKs for mobile application development:
- Offline-first data synchronization
- Push notification integration
- Authentication flows optimized for mobile

### AI-Enhanced Features
Integrate AI capabilities into the framework:
- Recommendation engines based on user activity
- Content summarization and generation
- Smart search with semantic understanding
- Anomaly detection for security and monitoring

### Developer Tooling
Enhance developer experience with better tooling:
- CLI for scaffolding and code generation
- Visual data modeling interface
- Performance profiling dashboard
- Migration assistance utilities

### Serverless Deployment
Optimize for serverless environments:
- Stateless request handling
- Cold start optimization
- Function-as-a-Service deployment templates
