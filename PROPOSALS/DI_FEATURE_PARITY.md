# Dependency Injection Feature Parity Analysis

This document analyzes the features of the existing DIContainer system and the UnoServiceProvider system to identify gaps that need to be addressed during the transition.

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | DIContainer | UnoServiceProvider | Description | Implementation Plan |
|---------|------------|-------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Registration** |
| Singleton registration | ✅ | ✅ | Register a service as a singleton | Already implemented in both systems |
| Scoped registration | ✅ | ✅ | Register a service with scoped lifetime | Already implemented in both systems |
| Transient registration | ✅ | ✅ | Register a service with transient lifetime | Already implemented in both systems |
| Instance registration | ✅ | ❌ | Register an existing instance | Need to add `register_instance` method to UnoServiceProvider |
| Factory registration | ✅ | ✅ | Register a factory function | Supported through lambda in register method |
| Type-based registration | ✅ | ✅ | Register a service by its type | Both systems support this |
| Interface-based registration | ✅ | ✅ | Register a service to an interface | Both systems support this |
| **Resolution** |
| Service resolution | ✅ | ✅ | Resolve a service by type | Both systems support get_service |
| Scope-aware resolution | ✅ | ✅ | Respect service lifetime during resolution | Both systems handle this correctly |
| Constructor injection | ✅ | ❌ | Automatically inject dependencies into constructor | Need to implement in UnoServiceProvider |
| Circular dependency resolution | ❌ | ✅ | Handle circular dependencies | UnoServiceProvider has add_container_configured_callback |
| **Lifecycle Management** |
| Initialization hooks | ✅ | ❌ | Initialize services after creation | Need to implement in UnoServiceProvider |
| Disposal hooks | ✅ | ❌ | Dispose of services when container is destroyed | Need to implement in UnoServiceProvider |
| Async disposal | ✅ | ❌ | Async cleanup of resources | Need to implement in UnoServiceProvider |
| **Scoping** |
| Create scope | ✅ | ✅ | Create new scope | Both systems support this |
| Async scopes | ✅ | ✅ | Async context manager for scopes | Both systems support this |
| Nested scopes | ✅ | ❌ | Support for nested scopes | Need to implement in UnoServiceProvider |
| **Framework Integration** |
| FastAPI integration | ✅ | ❌ | Integration with FastAPI | Need to update fastapi_integration.py |
| **Domain-Specific Providers** |
| Module-specific providers | ❌ | ✅ | Domain-specific service providers | UnoServiceProvider's main advantage |
| Provider composition | ❌ | ✅ | Compose multiple providers | register_extension method in UnoServiceProvider |
| **Decorator Support** |
| Service decorators | ✅ | ✅ | Register services with decorators | Both systems support this |
| Injection decorators | ✅ | ✅ | Inject dependencies with decorators | Both systems support this |
| **Other Features** |
| Error handling | ✅ | ✅ | Proper error handling | Both systems handle errors appropriately |
| Performance | ✅ | ❌ | Optimized performance | Need to optimize UnoServiceProvider |
| Testing utilities | ✅ | ❌ | Utilities for testing with DI | Need to implement in UnoServiceProvider |

## Key Implementation Tasks

Based on the feature comparison, here are the key tasks needed to achieve feature parity:

1. **Instance Registration**
   - Add a `register_instance` method to UnoServiceProvider
   - Ensure it behaves the same as DIContainer

2. **Constructor Injection**
   - Implement constructor parameter injection in UnoServiceProvider
   - Support automatic resolution of dependencies

3. **Lifecycle Management**
   - Add initialization hooks to UnoServiceProvider
   - Implement disposal mechanisms

4. **Nested Scopes**
   - Add support for nested scopes in UnoServiceProvider
   - Ensure proper inheritance of services

5. **FastAPI Integration**
   - Update fastapi_integration.py to work with UnoServiceProvider
   - Test all scenarios

6. **Performance Optimization**
   - Analyze and optimize UnoServiceProvider performance
   - Add caching where appropriate

7. **Testing Utilities**
   - Implement testing utilities for UnoServiceProvider
   - Create mock providers and services

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**
   - Instance registration
   - Constructor injection
   - Lifecycle management

2. **Medium Priority**
   - FastAPI integration
   - Testing utilities

3. **Low Priority**
   - Nested scopes
   - Performance optimization (can be done after initial implementation)

## Conclusion

The UnoServiceProvider system already has many of the core features needed for dependency injection, but there are several important features from DIContainer that need to be implemented to achieve feature parity. The most significant gaps are in lifecycle management, constructor injection, and integration with FastAPI.

By addressing these gaps systematically, we can create a comprehensive domain-oriented dependency injection system that provides all the functionality of DIContainer while maintaining the benefits of domain-specific providers.
