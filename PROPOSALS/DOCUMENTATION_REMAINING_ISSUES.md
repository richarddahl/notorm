# Documentation Remaining Issues

This document identifies the remaining documentation issues that need to be addressed in future documentation sprints for the Uno framework. For a visual representation of documentation status and priorities, see [DOCUMENTATION_STATUS_VISUALIZATION.md](./DOCUMENTATION_STATUS_VISUALIZATION.md).

## Broken Links

The `standardize_docs.py` script has identified approximately 112 broken links across 36 documentation files. We've fixed several key links, but many still need attention. Here's the current status:

### Fixed Documentation Areas

1. **Core Documentation**
   - ✅ `docs/index.md`: Fixed links to documentation process files
   - ✅ `docs/testing/framework.md`: Fixed link to TEST_STANDARDIZATION_PLAN.md
   - ✅ `docs/core/dependency_injection.md`: Fixed links to examples and advanced patterns

2. **Module Documentation**
   - ✅ `docs/database/overview.md`: Fixed links to Models Layer, SQL Generation, and Dependency Injection
   - ✅ `docs/business_logic/overview.md`: Fixed links to API, Database, and Schema Management 
   - ✅ `docs/business_logic/registry.md`: Fixed links to API Integration and Dependency Injection
   - ✅ `docs/architecture/overview.md`: Fixed links to related documentation sections
   - ✅ `docs/architecture/graph_database.md`: Fixed links and added TODOs for missing documentation
   - ✅ `docs/api/overview.md`: Fixed links to other core components
   - ✅ `docs/workflows/overview.md`: Fixed existing links and commented out missing documentation with TODOs
   - ✅ `docs/queries/overview.md` and `docs/queries/index.md`: Fixed links to related documentation with TODOs for missing files

### Still Needs Attention

All critical documentation links have been fixed or properly marked with TODOs. Here's what we've fixed:

1. **Recently Fixed Documentation**:
   - ✅ `docs/developer_tools.md`: Fixed scaffolding guide reference
   - ✅ `docs/reports/overview.md`: Fixed broken links to supporting documentation with TODOs

### Missing Documentation Files

Several documentation files are referenced but don't exist yet. These have been clearly marked with TODOs in their respective documentation files:

1. **Workflows Documentation**
   - API Reference documentation (`/docs/api/workflows.md`)
   - Advanced workflow patterns (`/docs/workflows/advanced-patterns.md`)
   - Custom extensions guide (`/docs/workflows/custom-extensions.md`)
   - Security considerations for workflows (`/docs/workflows/security.md`)

2. **Queries Documentation**
   - Filter manager documentation (`/docs/queries/filter-manager.md`)
   - Optimized queries documentation (`/docs/queries/optimized_queries.md`)
   - Common query patterns documentation (`/docs/queries/common_patterns.md`)

3. **Dependency Injection Documentation**
   - Testing with DI documentation (`/docs/testing/dependency_injection.md`)
   - Advanced DI patterns documentation (`/docs/advanced/di_patterns.md`)

4. **Developer Tools Documentation**
   - Scaffolding guide (`/docs/developer_tools/scaffolding.md`)

5. **Reports Documentation**
   - Report triggers documentation (`/docs/reports/triggers.md`)
   - Report outputs documentation (`/docs/reports/outputs.md`)
   - Report execution documentation (`/docs/reports/execution.md`)
   - Report events documentation (`/docs/reports/events.md`)
   - Report CLI documentation (`/docs/reports/cli.md`)
   - API reference documentation for reports

6. **Architecture Documentation**
   - AI integration documentation (`/docs/ai/overview.md`)
   - Performance optimization documentation (`/docs/performance/overview.md`)

7. **Visual Assets**
   - Benchmark dashboard screenshot

8. **Missing Example Files**
   - `docs/examples/education_reports.py`: Referenced by reports documentation
   - `docs/examples/real_estate_reports.py`: Referenced by reports documentation
   - `docs/examples/energy_reports.py`: Referenced by reports documentation
   - `docs/examples/logistics_reports.py`: Referenced by reports documentation

9. **Missing API Documentation**
   - `docs/api/workflows.md`: Referenced by workflow documentation
   - `docs/api/reports.md`: Referenced by reports documentation

## Formatting Issues

While many formatting issues have been resolved, some areas still need attention:

1. **Code Block Language Identifiers**
   - Some code blocks still lack language identifiers
   - Inconsistent use of language identifiers (e.g., `python` vs `py`)

2. **Indentation Issues**
   - Some nested lists have inconsistent indentation
   - Code block indentation sometimes differs within the same document

3. **Heading Hierarchy**
   - Some documents have inconsistent heading levels
   - Skipping heading levels (e.g., going from H2 to H4 without H3)

## Content Gaps

Several documentation areas have content gaps that need to be addressed:

1. **Conceptual Documentation**
   - Deeper explanations of the Domain-Driven Design principles in Uno
   - More detailed architecture documentation for complex components
   - Clearer migration guides from legacy patterns to modern approaches

2. **Example Code**
   - More real-world examples in key components
   - End-to-end examples linking multiple components
   - Examples with common integration patterns

3. **Missing Sections**
   - Some documentation files have TODO markers or incomplete sections
   - References to features without detailed explanations
   - Missing configuration options in some component documentation

## Documentation Structure Issues

The overall documentation structure could be improved:

1. **Inconsistent Organization**
   - Some related components are documented in different sections
   - Inconsistent depth of documentation across components
   - Varying levels of detail in overview pages

2. **Navigation Improvements**
   - Better cross-referencing between related components
   - More consistent "See Also" sections
   - Clearer documentation hierarchy

3. **Documentation Searchability**
   - Improve indexing for searchability
   - More consistent use of keywords and terminology
   - Better tagging of documentation sections

## Action Plan

To address these issues systematically:

1. **Link Fixing Sprint**
   - Prioritize fixing links in core documentation (index, overview pages)
   - Create missing overview.md files for key components
   - Update references to non-existent files
   - Use `standardize_docs.py --fix` to automate fixes where possible

2. **Content Completion Sprint**
   - Identify and complete missing sections in documentation
   - Add examples where indicated by TODOs
   - Expand thin documentation areas with more detail

3. **Structural Improvements**
   - Standardize documentation structure across components
   - Improve navigation between related documentation
   - Ensure consistent depth of documentation

This document will be updated as issues are addressed to track progress toward comprehensive, high-quality documentation coverage.
