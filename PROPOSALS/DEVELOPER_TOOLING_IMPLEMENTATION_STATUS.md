# Developer Tooling Implementation Status

## Overview

We've implemented a comprehensive developer tooling infrastructure to enhance the Uno framework's developer experience. The implementation follows a modular, extensible design that aligns with modern CLI best practices.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Command Line Interface (CLI)

✅ **Scaffolding Module**: A complete feature scaffolding system that can:

- Create new Uno projects from templates
- Scaffold complete features with entities, repositories, services, and endpoints
- Generate unit and integration tests automatically

The implementation includes:

- Template-based code generation with Jinja2
- Project structure detection and analysis
- Configuration-driven scaffolding
- Rich terminal UI for better feedback

### 2. Templates

✅ **Project Templates**: Basic templates for new Uno projects with configurable options:

- Standard project structure with common directories
- Domain-driven design project structure
- API integration options

✅ **Component Templates**: Templates for creating domain components:

- Entity models with validation
- Repository interfaces and implementations
- Service implementations with business logic
- API endpoints with FastAPI integration
- Unit and integration tests

### 3. Visual Data Modeling Interface

✅ **Entity Modeler**: A web-based visual modeling tool for creating entity models:

- Interactive diagram editor with drag-and-drop interface
- Entity and relationship definition
- Field management with type specification
- Code generation from visual models
- Export/import of model definitions

The implementation includes:

- Web Components-based interface with lit-element
- D3.js for interactive diagramming
- Real-time code generation previews
- FastAPI backend for model processing

### 4. AI-Assisted Development

✅ **Code Generation**: AI-enhanced code generation capabilities:

- Intelligent code completion and suggestions
- Context-aware template customization
- Code pattern recognition and implementation
- Automatic documentation generation

The implementation includes:

- Integration with embedding models for code understanding
- RAG-based context retrieval for code suggestions
- Template enhancement with AI-generated components
- Semantic code search capabilities

## Integration with Existing Codebase

The implementation is designed to work with the existing CLI infrastructure in `uno.devtools.cli`:

- Added a new `scaffold` command to the CLI
- Added a new `modeler` command for the visual modeler
- Integrated with the existing Typer-based CLI
- Implemented fallback for non-Typer environments

## Current Limitations

- There appears to be an import conflict with the existing codebase related to `UnoRepository` 
- The CLI needs testing with the current project structure
- Some template adjustments may be needed for full compatibility
- The visual modeler needs comprehensive testing with complex entity relationships

## Current Focus

We're now focusing on implementing the Performance Profiling Dashboard as our next major feature, while continuing to refine existing components.

## Completed Items

### 1. Core CLI Framework ✅
- ✅ Basic CLI infrastructure with both Typer and fallback mode
- ✅ Project scaffolding system 
- ✅ Feature component generation
- ✅ Template-based code generation

### 2. Visual Data Modeling ✅
- ✅ Interactive entity modeling interface with Web Components
- ✅ Entity relationship visualization and management
- ✅ Code generation for domain models, repositories, and services
- ✅ Integration with CLI through modeler commands
- ✅ Project analysis capabilities

### 3. AI Integration (Basic) ✅
- ✅ Integration with vector search capabilities
- ✅ Enhanced template generation with AI suggestions
- ✅ Entity relationship detection in existing code
- ✅ RAG-based code documentation generation

## Next Steps

### 1. Performance Profiling Dashboard (Current Priority)

1. Design profiling middleware for FastAPI
2. Implement SQL query analysis tools
3. Create real-time metrics collection system
4. Build visualization dashboard with Web Components
5. Add hotspot detection and analysis

### 2. AI Integration Enhancements

1. Add AI-assisted troubleshooting features
2. Create AI-powered code review and suggestions
3. Develop intelligent test generation based on code analysis
4. Implement AI-based performance optimization recommendations

### 3. Short-term Enhancements

1. Add more sophisticated project templates
2. Create template customization options
3. Support for scaffold plugins
4. Add code inspection capabilities
5. Integrate content generation for code documentation

### 4. Future Features

1. **Visual Data Modeling Enhancements**:
   - Add database schema synchronization
   - Implement advanced relationship types
   - Create real-time collaboration features
   - Add version control integration
   - Implement AI-assisted model optimization suggestions

2. **Migration Assistance**:
   - Enhance database migration capabilities
   - Add codebase transformation utilities
   - Support schema evolution
   - Create AI-guided migration paths

## Usage Examples

### Creating a New Project

```bash
# Using typer
python -m uno.devtools.cli.main scaffold new my_project --template standard --database postgresql

# Using argparse
python -m uno.devtools.cli.main scaffold new my_project --template standard --database postgresql
```

### Scaffolding a Feature

```bash
# Using typer
python -m uno.devtools.cli.main scaffold feature product --domain ecommerce

# Using argparse
python -m uno.devtools.cli.main scaffold feature product --domain ecommerce
```

### Using the Visual Data Modeler

```bash
# Launch the visual data modeler
python -m uno.devtools.cli.main modeler start

# Analyze an existing project
python -m uno.devtools.cli.main modeler analyze /path/to/project
```

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows these design principles:

1. **Modularity**: Components are isolated and can be developed independently
2. **Template-Driven**: All code generation is template-based for flexibility
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: CLI works with or without extra dependencies
4. **Consistent Feedback**: Rich UI when available, clear text otherwise
5. **Project Awareness**: Tools understand the project context they operate in
6. **Web Standards**: Using Web Components for all browser-based tools

## Recommendations

For optimal integration and user adoption:

1. Resolve the import conflicts with a proper dependency structure
2. Enhance the existing CLI structure to better support the new commands
3. Add comprehensive documentation for all commands
4. Create tutorials for common scaffolding scenarios and visual modeling
5. Implement CI tests to ensure commands function correctly
6. Add examples of integrating the visual modeler with existing projects
