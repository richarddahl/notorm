## Usage Examples

### Graph SQL Emitters

```python
from uno.sql.emitters.graph import GraphSQLEmitter
from uno.model import UnoModel
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, ForeignKey

# Define relational models
class User(UnoModel):
    __tablename__ = "users"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
    email = Column(String)

# Create graph emitter for the model
emitter = GraphSQLEmitter(table=User.__table__, schema="public")

# Generate SQL for graph integration
sql_statements = emitter.generate_sql()

# Execute the statements to set up graph triggers
for stmt in sql_statements:
    await session.execute(stmt.sql)
```

### Graph Path Queries

```python
from uno.domain.graph_path_query import GraphPathQuery, PathQuerySpecification

# Create a graph path query executor
graph_query = GraphPathQuery(track_performance=True, use_cache=True)

# Define a path query specification
query_spec = PathQuerySpecification(
    path="(s:User)-[:CREATED]->(p:Post)",
    params={"s.name": "John Doe"},
    limit=10
)

# Execute the query
entity_ids, metadata = await graph_query.execute(query_spec)
```

### Advanced Graph Navigation

```python
from uno.ai.graph_integration.graph_navigator import create_graph_navigator

# Create a graph navigator
navigator = await create_graph_navigator(
    connection_string="postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname",
    graph_name="knowledge_graph"
)

# Find the shortest path between two nodes
path = await navigator.find_shortest_path(
    start_node_id="user123",
    end_node_id="post456",
    relationship_types=["CREATED", "VIEWED", "COMMENTED_ON"],
    max_depth=5
)

# Extract a subgraph centered on a node
subgraph = await navigator.extract_subgraph(
    center_node_id="user123",
    max_depth=3,
    relationship_types=["FOLLOWS", "FRIENDS_WITH"]
)

# Find paths with reasoning
path = await navigator.find_path_with_reasoning(
    start_node_id="concept1",

    reasoning_type="causal",
    max_depth=5

```python
from uno.ai.graph_integration.knowledge_constructor import create_knowledge_constructor, TextSource

# Create a knowledge constructor
constructor = await create_knowledge_constructor(
    connection_string="postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname",
    graph_name="knowledge_graph"
)

# Create text sources
sources = [
    TextSource(
        id="source1",
        content="Acme Corp is located in New York City. John Smith is the CEO of Acme Corp."
    )
]

# Construct knowledge graph
result = await constructor.construct_knowledge_graph(sources)

# Query the knowledge graph
entities = await constructor.query_graph("""
    MATCH (org:ORGANIZATION)-[r:LOCATED_IN]->(loc:LOCATION)
    WHERE org.properties->>'text' = 'Acme Corp'
    RETURN org, loc
""")
```

### Graph-Enhanced RAG

```python
from uno.ai.graph_integration.graph_rag import GraphRAGService, create_graph_rag_service

# Create the service with factory function
graph_rag = await create_graph_rag_service(
    connection_string="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/database",
    entity_type=Document,
    table_name="document",
    graph_name="knowledge_graph"
)

# Create a graph-enhanced prompt
prompt = await graph_rag.create_graph_enhanced_prompt(
    query="Explain the relationship between PostgreSQL and Apache AGE",
    system_prompt="You are a knowledgeable technical assistant...",
    limit=5,
    threshold=0.7,
    max_depth=3,
    strategy="hybrid"
)

# Combine vector and graph context
hybrid_prompt = await graph_rag.create_hybrid_rag_prompt(
    query="What are the best practices for using PostgreSQL with Apache AGE?",
    system_prompt="You are a helpful database expert...",
    vector_limit=3,
    graph_limit=3,
    threshold=0.7,
    max_depth=2
)

# Get context from a path between entities
path_context = await graph_rag.retrieve_path_context(
    start_node_id="document-123",
    end_node_id="document-456",
    max_depth=3,
    relationship_types=["REFERENCES", "RELATED_TO"],
    reasoning_type="causal"
