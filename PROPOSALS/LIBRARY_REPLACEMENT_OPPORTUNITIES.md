## Implementation Strategy

For successfully replacing custom components with third-party libraries:

1. **Prioritization:**
   - Start with isolated components that provide the most value:
     - Background tasks (Dramatiq)
     - Validation (Pydantic v2)
     - Monitoring (OpenTelemetry)

2. **Approach:**
   - Create adapter layers to ease transitions
   - Implement one component at a time
   - Write comprehensive tests before and after migration
   - Use feature flags to enable gradual rollout

3. **Risk Mitigation:**
   - Begin with non-critical paths
   - Consider A/B testing approaches
   - Have a rollback strategy for each component
   - Monitor performance and behavior changes

4. **Timeline Considerations:**
   - Short-term wins: Monitoring, Testing Framework
   - Medium-term: Validation, Background Tasks, Realtime
   - Long-term: Database, Caching, Authorization

By strategically replacing custom implementations with well-supported libraries, the uno framework can benefit from community maintenance, additional features, and potentially improved performance while reducing the maintenance burden on the development team.
