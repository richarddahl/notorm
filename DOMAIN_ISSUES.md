# Domain Layer Issues & Recommendations

This document outlines recommended improvements for the Domain layer of the uno framework, which follows DDD, CQRS, and event-driven patterns. The goal is to further enhance maintainability, clarity, and alignment with best practices in modern Python application development.

## 1. Domain Event Handling
- **Centralize Event Dispatching:**
  Ensure all domain events are consistently collected and dispatched via a dedicated event bus. Aggregate roots should expose uncommitted events, and application services should be responsible for publishing them after successful operations.
- **Event Sourcing Support:**
  Consider extending aggregates to support event sourcing, enabling full traceability and replay of domain events.
- **Event Payload Consistency:**
  Standardize event payloads and metadata (e.g., timestamps, correlation IDs) for reliable integration with external systems.

## 2. Richer Domain Models
- **Encapsulate Business Logic:**
  Continue moving business rules into entities, value objects, and aggregates. Avoid anemic domain models by ensuring that domain objects contain both data and behavior.
- **Explicit Invariants:**
  Use methods and factory functions to enforce invariants at the aggregate level.

## 3. Value Objects and Immutability
- **Enforce Immutability:**
  Ensure all value objects are truly immutable, using Python's `@dataclass(frozen=True)` or Pydantic's `frozen=True` config where possible.
- **Equality and Hashing:**
  Implement rich equality and hashing methods for value objects to support correct usage in sets and as dictionary keys.

## 4. Aggregate Boundaries
- **Clear Boundaries:**
  Review aggregate root definitions to ensure transactional consistency boundaries are explicit and well-documented.
- **Aggregate Factories:**
  Use factory methods for aggregate creation to encapsulate complex construction and validation logic.

## 5. Repository Abstractions
- **Interface Consistency:**
  Ensure all repositories follow a consistent async interface and return `Result` types for error handling.
- **Specification Pattern:**
  Promote use of the specification pattern for flexible, composable querying.

## 6. Domain Services
- **Statelessness:**
  Keep domain services stateless, operating only on parameters and repositories.
- **Result Monad:**
  Ensure all service methods return `Result` types for robust, functional error handling (as per current refactor).

## 7. Error Handling
- **Domain-Specific Errors:**
  Prefer custom domain exceptions or error types over generic exceptions. Document all domain errors.
- **Result Monad Everywhere:**
  Complete the transition to `Result` types (Success/Failure) across all domain logic, including helpers and utilities.

## 8. Dependency Injection
- **No Ad Hoc Providers:**
  Remove any remaining ad hoc provider modules. All dependencies (repositories, services, event buses) should be resolved via the central DI container.
- **Testability:**
  Ensure all domain components are easily mockable and testable in isolation.

## 9. Documentation & Ubiquitous Language
- **Domain Language:**
  Ensure code, comments, and documentation use the language of the domain experts (ubiquitous language).
- **Module-Level Docs:**
  Add or update module-level docstrings explaining aggregate boundaries, invariants, and business rules.

## 10. CQRS & Event-Driven Patterns
- **Command/Query Separation:**
  Maintain strict separation of command and query responsibilities in services and repositories.
- **Event Publication:**
  Ensure all state-changing operations result in domain events that are published asynchronously.

These recommendations will help maintain a clean, robust, and evolvable Domain layer, supporting the uno framework's goals of DDD and event-driven architecture. Progress should be tracked in this file as improvements are implemented.
