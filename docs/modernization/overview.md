# uno Framework Modernization

## Introduction

The uno framework is undergoing a significant modernization effort to make it more modular, loosely coupled, and aligned with modern Python best practices. This document provides an overview of the changes and explains the rationale behind them.

## Goals

The primary goals of the modernization effort are:

1. **Improve Modularity**: Make the framework more modular, with clear boundaries between components
2. **Reduce Coupling**: Decrease dependencies between components to enable better testability and maintainability
3. **Enhance Performance**: Improve performance through better resource management and optimized code
4. **Simplify Extension**: Make it easier to extend the framework with new functionality
5. **Embrace Modern Python**: Take advantage of modern Python features like protocols, async/await, and type hints

## Architectural Improvements

### Protocol-Based Design

The framework now uses Python's Protocol class extensively to define interfaces, enabling better dependency injection and loose coupling.

**Benefits:**
- Clear definition of component interfaces
- Static type checking of implementation conformance
- Better IDE support for implementing interfaces
- No need for inheritance or abstract base classes

### Domain-Driven Design Architecture

The framework now provides building blocks for implementing Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles.

**Benefits:**
- Focus on business domain modeling
- Clear distinction between domain and infrastructure concerns
- Better alignment with business requirements
- More maintainable and understandable codebase

### Event-Driven Architecture

The framework now supports event-driven architecture with both synchronous and asynchronous event handling.

**Benefits:**
- Loose coupling between components
- Better support for complex business processes
- Easier integration with external systems
- Improved scalability

### CQRS Pattern Implementation

The framework now separates command (write) operations from query (read) operations for better performance and scalability.

**Benefits:**
- Independent scaling of read and write operations
- Optimized data models for different types of operations
- Better performance for complex queries
- More explicit handling of business operations

### Enhanced Dependency Injection

The framework now provides a modern dependency injection system with proper scoping and lifecycle management.

**Benefits:**
- Automatic resolution of dependencies
- Proper management of component lifecycles
- Support for different scopes (singleton, scoped, transient)
- Easier testing through dependency substitution

### Functional Error Handling

The framework now uses the Result pattern (also known as Either pattern) for handling errors without exceptions.

**Benefits:**
- More explicit error handling
- Better type safety for error cases
- Composable error handling with monadic operations
- Elimination of try/except blocks for expected errors

### Unit of Work Pattern

The framework now provides a Unit of Work pattern for managing transaction boundaries.

**Benefits:**
- Consistent transaction management
- Automatic event publishing after successful transactions
- Better handling of domain events
- All-or-nothing operations

### Enhanced Configuration Management

The framework now provides a flexible and extensible configuration system.

**Benefits:**
- Support for multiple configuration sources
- Environment-aware configuration
- Typed configuration values
- Validation of configuration

## Migration Strategy

The modernization effort is designed to be backward compatible, allowing gradual migration of existing applications. Key aspects of the migration strategy include:

1. **Dual Implementation**: Both old and new approaches are supported simultaneously
2. **Feature Flags**: New features can be enabled or disabled as needed
3. **Gradual Migration**: Applications can migrate components one at a time
4. **Compatibility Layers**: Adapters are provided for integrating old and new components

See the [Migration Guide](migration.md) for detailed instructions on migrating existing applications.

## Getting Involved

We welcome contributions to the modernization effort! Here's how you can get involved:

1. **Try the new features**: Use the new features in your applications and provide feedback
2. **Report issues**: File issues on GitHub for any problems you encounter
3. **Contribute code**: Submit pull requests for bug fixes or enhancements
4. **Improve documentation**: Help us improve the documentation for the new features
