# Legacy Code Cleanup

This document provides details about the legacy code cleanup effort in uno. It covers the motivation, patterns that were removed, and their modern replacements.

## Motivation

The legacy code cleanup effort was motivated by the need to:

1. **Simplify Codebase**: Remove deprecated patterns and approaches that made the codebase harder to understand
2. **Enhance Type Safety**: Leverage modern Python type checking capabilities
3. **Improve Testability**: Make the code easier to test by ensuring clear dependencies
4. **Reduce Technical Debt**: Eliminate workarounds and patches accumulated over time
5. **Enable Modern Patterns**: Make way for modern architectural patterns like CQRS and DDD

## Legacy Patterns Removed

### 1. `inject` Library Usage

The codebase previously used the `inject` library for dependency injection, which has several limitations:

- Global state with `inject.instance()`
- Limited scope management
- No built-in lifecycle management
- Manual configuration of bindings

**Files Affected**:
- Removed from all files, especially in service and repository implementations
- Former pattern: `@inject.params()` decorators and `inject.instance()` calls

**Modern Replacement**:
- Constructor-based dependency injection
- `uno.core.di` module with `DIContainer`
- Service registration by lifetime (Singleton, Scoped, Transient)
- `get_service()` function for service resolution

**Example**:
```python
# Old pattern
@inject.params(db_manager=DBManager)
def __init__(self, db_manager: DBManager):```

self.db_manager = db_manager
```

def some_method(self):```

registry = inject.instance(UnoRegistry)
# ...
```

# New pattern
def __init__(self, db_manager: DBManager, registry: UnoRegistry):```

self.db_manager = db_manager
``````

self.registry = registry
```

# Used with:
service = ServiceClass(get_service(DBManager), get_service(UnoRegistry))
```

### 2. Singleton `get_instance()` Pattern

Many classes implemented a singleton pattern using a class method `get_instance()`:

```python
class SomeManager:```

_instance = None
``````

```
```

@classmethod
def get_instance(cls):```

if cls._instance is None:
    cls._instance = cls()
return cls._instance
```
```
```

**Problems**:
- Hidden dependencies
- Difficult testing
- No lifecycle management
- Global mutable state

**Modern Replacement**:
- Dependency Injection with proper lifetime management
- Singleton registration in DI container
- Clear dependencies through constructor injection

**Example**:
```python
# Old pattern
class QueryCacheManager:```

_instance = None
``````

```
```

@classmethod
def get_instance(cls):```

if cls._instance is None:
    cls._instance = cls()
return cls._instance
```
```

# Usage
cache = QueryCacheManager.get_instance()

# New pattern
# Registration:
services.add_singleton(QueryCacheManager)

# Usage:
cache = get_service(QueryCacheManager)
```

### 3. Legacy Result Pattern

The codebase used a Result pattern with methods like `unwrap()`, `is_ok()`, and `is_err()`:

**Problems**:
- Inconsistent naming with Python conventions
- Limited error context
- No integration with Python's exception system

**Modern Replacement**:
- Updated Result pattern with `is_success`/`is_failure` and `value`/`error` properties
- Rich error context with proper error categories
- Integration with structured logging

**Example**:
```python
# Old pattern
result = some_operation()
if result.is_ok():```

value = result.unwrap()
```
else:```

error = result.unwrap_err()
```

# New pattern
result = some_operation()
if result.is_success:```

value = result.value
```
else:```

error = result.error
```
```

### 4. Circular Import Problems

The codebase had several circular import issues that made refactoring difficult:

**Modern Replacement**:
- Protocol-based interfaces in central location
- Forward references with `TYPE_CHECKING`
- Proper module organization

## Validation Script

To ensure that all legacy patterns have been removed, we developed a validation script:

```python
python src/scripts/validate_clean_slate.py
```

This script checks for:
1. Banned imports from legacy DI modules
2. Legacy class usage and `get_instance()` calls
3. Legacy Result pattern methods like `unwrap()`, `is_ok()`, `is_err()`
4. Any remaining `inject.instance()` calls

## Migration Strategy

For teams migrating existing applications, follow these steps:

1. **Update Dependencies**: Ensure the latest uno framework version is being used
2. **Replace Inject Import**: Remove `import inject` statements
3. **Constructor Injection**: Refactor to use constructor injection
4. **Update Result Handling**: Replace `unwrap()` with `value` and `is_ok()` with `is_success`
5. **Run Validation**: Use the validation script to check for remaining legacy patterns
6. **Update Tests**: Ensure tests are updated to match the new patterns

## Benefits of Migration

Migrating to the modern uno framework provides several benefits:

1. **Better Testability**: Services with explicit dependencies are easier to test
2. **Enhanced Type Safety**: Better IDE support and type checking
3. **Improved Error Handling**: More context for errors makes debugging easier
4. **Cleaner Architecture**: Better separation of concerns and modularity
5. **Performance Improvements**: Optimized resource management
6. **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify code
7. **Future-Ready**: Ready for modern Python features and patterns
