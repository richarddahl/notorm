# Schema Module API [DEPRECATED]

> **IMPORTANT**: This documentation is deprecated. The Schema module has been renamed to DTO module to better align with Domain-Driven Design principles. 
>
> Please refer to the following documentation instead:
> - [DTO Overview](/dto/overview.md)
> - [API DTOs](/api/dto.md)
> - [DTO Manager](/dto/manager.md)
>
> See the [Schema to DTO Transition](/modernization/dto_transition.md) guide for more details on this change.

The Schema module has been replaced by the DTO module, which provides a domain-driven approach to data transfer between different layers of the application.
