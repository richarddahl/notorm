# UnoObj Schema System [DEPRECATED]

> **IMPORTANT**: This documentation is deprecated. The `UnoSchema` and schema-related classes have been renamed to use DTO terminology to better align with Domain-Driven Design principles. 
>
> Please refer to the following documentation instead:
> - [DTO Overview](/dto/overview.md)
> - [API DTOs](/api/dto.md)
>
> See the [Schema to DTO Transition](/modernization/dto_transition.md) guide for more details on this change.

The schema system has been replaced by the DTO system, which provides a more consistent approach to data transfer between layers in the application.
