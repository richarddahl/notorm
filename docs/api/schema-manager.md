# Schema Manager [DEPRECATED]

> **IMPORTANT**: This documentation is deprecated. The `UnoSchemaManager` class has been renamed to `DTOManager` to better align with Domain-Driven Design principles. 
>
> Please refer to the following documentation instead:
> - [DTO Manager](/dto/manager.md)
> - [API DTO Manager](/api/dto-manager.md)
>
> See the [Schema to DTO Transition](/modernization/dto_transition.md) guide for more details on this change.

The `UnoSchemaManager` class has been replaced by the `DTOManager` class, which is responsible for creating and managing Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for domain entities and data models.
