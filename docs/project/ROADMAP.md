# Uno Framework Modernization Roadmap (May 2025 Update)

This roadmap outlines the key improvements planned for the Uno framework to make it more modular, loosely coupled, and aligned with modern Python best practices. All planned roadmap items have been completed as of May 2025.

## Legacy Code Cleanup (✅ Completed May 2025)

We have successfully completed a thorough cleanup of legacy code patterns:

- [x] **Removal of Legacy DI System**: Replaced `inject` library with modern dependency injection

- [x] **Result Pattern Modernization**: Updated result handling to use modern conventions
- [x] **Circular Import Resolution**: Solved circular import issues with protocol-based design
- [x] **Python 3.12+ Features**: Full adoption of the latest Python language features

## Core Architecture Standardization (✅ Completed)

The framework has now been completely standardized using a Domain-Driven Design architecture, following these key milestones:

- [x] **Phase 1**: Created comprehensive migration plan from UnoObj to Domain approach
- [x] **Phase 2**: Implementation of Domain infrastructure (Entity, Repository, Service patterns)
- [x] **Phase 3**: Module-by-module conversion of all core modules
- [x] **Phase 4**: Testing and API adaptation, including performance benchmarks

## Future Directions

With the completion of the standardization effort, we recommend the following future directions:

1. **Extended Testing Coverage**: Continue expanding benchmark tests to other modules
2. **API Documentation**: Generate comprehensive API docs from standardized codebase
3. **Performance Optimization**: Use benchmark results to identify and optimize bottlenecks
