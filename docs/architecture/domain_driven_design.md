# Domain-Driven Design in the Uno Framework

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a software development approach that focuses on creating a rich, expressive domain model that closely mirrors real-world business concepts. The Uno framework embraces DDD principles to create maintainable, flexible software that aligns with business needs.

## Core Concepts

### Domain Model

The domain model is a conceptual model of the business domain that incorporates both behavior and data. In the Uno framework, we've implemented core domain model components:

- **Entities**: Objects defined by their identity, with continuity through time
- **Value Objects**: Immutable objects defined by their attributes, without identity
- **Aggregates**: Clusters of related objects treated as a single unit
- **Domain Events**: Records of significant occurrences within the domain
- **Repositories**: Collection-like interfaces for accessing domain objects
- **Domain Services**: Stateless operations that don't naturally belong to entities

### Strategic Design

Strategic design is about dealing with complexity by dividing the domain into manageable contexts:

- **Bounded Contexts**: Explicit boundaries within which a particular model applies
- **Context Maps**: Documentation of relationships between bounded contexts
- **Ubiquitous Language**: A consistent language shared by all team members within a context

### Tactical Design Patterns

Tactical design patterns are implementation patterns for expressing the domain model:

- **Factories**: Encapsulate object creation logic
- **Repositories**: Provide collection-like access to domain objects
- **Services**: Implement domain operations that don't belong to entities
- **Specifications**: Encapsulate business rules and query criteria
- **Layered Architecture**: Separate domain logic from infrastructure concerns

## Implementation in Uno Framework

### Domain Model Layer

The domain model in Uno is implemented in the `uno.domain` package:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import List, Optional
from uuid import UUID

from uno.domain.core import Entity, AggregateRoot, ValueObject, DomainEvent

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Address(ValueObject):
    street: str
    city: str
    state: str
    zip_code: str
    country: str
    
    def validate(self) -> None:
        if not self.zip_code:
            raise ValueError("Zip code is required")

@dataclass
class User(AggregateRoot):
    username: str
    email: str
    first_name: Optional[str] = None
    last_name: Optional[str] = None
    addresses: List[Address] = field(default_factory=list)
    
    def add_address(self, address: Address) -> None:
        address.validate()
        self.addresses.append(address)
        self.register_event(UserAddressAddedEvent(self.id, address))
    
    def check_invariants(self) -> None:
        if not self.username:
            raise ValueError("Username is required")
        if not self.email:
            raise ValueError("Email is required")

class UserAddressAddedEvent(DomainEvent):
    user_id: UUID
    address: Address
```

### Repositories

Repositories abstract the persistence mechanism for domain objects:

```python
from typing import Optional, List, Dict, Any
from uuid import UUID

from uno.domain.model import User
from uno.domain.repository import Repository, AggregateRepository

class UserRepository(AggregateRepository[User, UUID]):
    async def get(self, id: UUID) -> Optional[User]:
        # Implementation details...
        pass
    
    async def save(self, user: User) -> None:
        # Implementation details...
        pass
    
    async def find_by_username(self, username: str) -> Optional[User]:
        # Implementation details...
        pass
```

### Domain Services

Domain services encapsulate domain operations that don't naturally fit within entities:

```python
from uno.domain.service import DomainService
from uno.domain.repository import UserRepository
from uno.domain.model import User, Address

class UserService(DomainService):
    def __init__(self, user_repository: UserRepository):
        self.user_repository = user_repository
    
    async def change_user_primary_address(self, user_id: UUID, address: Address) -> User:
        user = await self.user_repository.get(user_id)
        if not user:
            raise EntityNotFoundError("User", user_id)
        
        # Domain logic...
        user.addresses.insert(0, address)
        user.register_event(UserPrimaryAddressChangedEvent(user_id, address))
        
        await self.user_repository.save(user)
        return user
```

### Unit of Work

The Unit of Work pattern coordinates operations and transaction management:

```python
from uno.domain.unit_of_work import UnitOfWork
from uno.domain.repository import UserRepository

async with UnitOfWork() as uow:
    user_repo = uow.get_repository(UserRepository)
    user = await user_repo.get(user_id)
    user.update_email(new_email)
    await user_repo.save(user)
    # Transaction is committed on successful exit
```

### Bounded Contexts

Uno organizes code into bounded contexts, each with its own model and responsibility:

```
uno/
├── api/               # API Context
├── authorization/     # Authorization Context
├── database/          # Database Context
├── domain/            # Domain Model Context
├── meta/              # Meta Context
├── queries/           # Query Context
├── schema/            # Schema Context
└── sql/               # SQL Generation Context
```

Each context has a clear responsibility and maintains its own ubiquitous language.

## Layered Architecture

The Uno framework implements a layered architecture to separate concerns:

### Domain Layer

Contains the business logic and domain objects:
- Entities, value objects, aggregates
- Domain events and domain services
- Domain exceptions and business rules
- Repository interfaces (but not implementations)

### Application Layer

Coordinates domain objects to perform application tasks:
- Application services
- Command and query handlers
- Transaction management
- External API integration

### Infrastructure Layer

Provides technical capabilities needed by higher layers:
- Repository implementations
- Database access
- API endpoints
- Event handling infrastructure
- Messaging

### Presentation Layer

Handles user interaction:
- Web controllers
- API endpoints
- User interfaces

## Benefiting from DDD in Uno

### Advantages

1. **Alignment with Business**: The model closely mirrors business concepts
2. **Handling Complexity**: Complex domains are made manageable through contexts
3. **Team Communication**: Ubiquitous language improves communication
4. **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries and responsibilities make the system more maintainable
5. **Flexibility**: Domain-focused design enables easy adaptation to business changes

### Best Practices

1. **Focus on the Core Domain**: Invest most in the most complex, valuable parts
2. **Engage with Domain Experts**: Continuous dialogue with subject matter experts
3. **Refine the Ubiquitous Language**: Documentation of key terms in each context
4. **Evolve the Model**: Continuous refinement based on growing understanding
5. **Respect Bounded Contexts**: Honor the boundaries between contexts

## Transition Strategy

For existing systems transitioning to DDD, Uno recommends:

1. **Identify Implicit Contexts**: Recognize existing implicit boundaries
2. **Make Boundaries Explicit**: Define clear context boundaries
3. **Create Anti-Corruption Layers**: Protect new models from legacy systems
4. **Refactor Incrementally**: Gradually move toward the target architecture
5. **Start with Core Domain**: Focus first on the most valuable parts

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Complex Domain
**Solution**: Break down into bounded contexts, focus on core domain first

### Challenge: Legacy Integration
**Solution**: Use anti-corruption layers, adapt-in/adapt-out pattern

### Challenge: Team Alignment
**Solution**: Develop and document ubiquitous language, use context mapping

### Challenge: Performance Concerns
**Solution**: Use CQRS pattern, optimize read models separately from write models

### Challenge: Technical Complexity
**Solution**: Separate technical concerns from domain concerns, use infrastructure layer

## Conclusion

Domain-Driven Design provides a powerful approach for building complex software systems. The Uno framework embraces DDD principles to create a maintainable, flexible, and business-aligned architecture.

By separating the domain model from infrastructure concerns, using bounded contexts to manage complexity, and implementing tactical patterns like entities, value objects, and repositories, Uno enables developers to build systems that can evolve with changing business needs.
