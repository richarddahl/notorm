# Background Processing System

The background processing system provides robust support for executing tasks asynchronously and on a schedule, enabling applications to handle time-consuming or resource-intensive operations without blocking the main application thread.

## Overview

Modern applications often need to perform operations that:
- Are time-consuming (e.g., generating reports, processing uploads)
- Should occur on a schedule (e.g., nightly data syncs, regular cleanups)
- Need to be retried on failure (e.g., external API calls)
- Should be processed in a distributed manner (e.g., parallel processing)

The Uno Background Processing system is designed to address these needs with a flexible, scalable architecture.

## Architecture

The system follows a distributed job processing architecture:

### Core Components

1. **Job Queue**: Stores pending jobs with priorities and manages job lifecycle
2. **Workers**: Process jobs from the queue with configurable concurrency
3. **Scheduler**: Creates jobs on a scheduled basis
4. **Job Manager**: Coordinates job execution and worker management
5. **Task Definitions**: Defines the actual work to be performed

## Key Features

### Job Prioritization

Jobs can be assigned priorities to ensure critical tasks get processed first:

- **Critical**: Highest priority, processed immediately
- **High**: Processed before normal and low priority jobs
- **Normal**: Standard priority for most jobs
- **Low**: Background tasks that can wait if resources are constrained

### Distributed Execution

The system supports both:

- **Local execution**: Jobs run in the same process/machine
- **Distributed execution**: Jobs run across multiple machines/containers

### Scheduling

Jobs can be scheduled using flexible expressions:

- Cron-style scheduling
- Interval-based scheduling
- One-time future execution
- Event-triggered scheduling

### Retry Policies

Configurable retry policies handle transient failures:

- Retry counts
- Delay between retries
- Exponential backoff
- Custom retry logic

### Monitoring

Comprehensive monitoring provides insights into system health:

- Job execution metrics
- Queue length and processing rates
- Worker utilization
- Failure rates and patterns

### Storage Backends

Different storage backends available for different needs:

- In-memory storage (for development)
- Database storage (for persistence)
- Redis-based storage (for high throughput)
- Custom storage implementations
