# Schema Service [DEPRECATED]

> **IMPORTANT**: This documentation is deprecated. The `UnoSchema` classes have been renamed to `UnoDTO` to better align with Domain-Driven Design principles.

> Please refer to the following documentation instead:
> - [DTO Overview](/dto/overview.md)
> - [DTO Manager](/dto/manager.md)
> - [DTO Service](/dto/dto_service.md)
> - [API DTO Documentation](/api/dto.md)
> - [API DTO Manager](/api/dto-manager.md)
>
> See the [Schema to DTO Transition](/modernization/dto_transition.md) guide for more details on this change.

The Schema Manager Service has been replaced by the DTO Manager Service, which provides a centralized way to create and manage DTOs for domain entities, data transfer objects, and database models with proper dependency injection and configuration.
