# Enhancing and Integrating the UnoServiceProvider

This document provides a plan for improving, extending, and deeply integrating the UnoServiceProvider into the application, ensuring a modern, efficient, and
maintainable dependency injection system.

## 1. Improvements to the UnoServiceProvider

### a. Console and Logging Enhancements

* Add detailed logging for each registration, resolution, initialization, and disposal action.
* Include timing metrics to monitor dependency resolution latency.

### b. Lifecycle Management

* Support more lifecycle hooks such as `on_startup` and `on_shutdown`.
* Add support for asynchronous cleanup, including background tasks or cleanup coroutines.

### c. Scoped Service Support

* Enhance scope management to support nested or hierarchical scopes.
* Enable explicit scope disposal and context management.

### d. Dynamic Registration

* Provide methods for runtime registration/deregistration of services.
* Support reconfiguration or hot-swapping of services in running applications.

### e. Dependency Validation

* Implement validation routines to check for missing dependencies, circular dependencies, and required lifetimes before startup.

### f. Extensibility Hooks

* Allow external modules or plugins to register services dynamically.
* Enable registration interceptors for custom behavior (e.g., logging, instrumentation).

### g. Thread-Safety and Concurrency

* Ensure thread-safe operations for registration and resolution.
* Support asynchronous resolution where applicable.

---

## 2. Extending Functionality

### a. Service Decorators

* Implement decorators (`@singleton`, `@scoped`, `@transient`) to simplify registration syntax.
* Allow attribute-based registration for auto-discovery.

### b. Advanced Scoping

* Implement named scopes for different application layers (e.g., request scope, background task scope).
* Support scope inheritance or parent-child relationships.

### c. Configuration Integration

* Auto-register configuration objects from environment variables or config files.
* Support environment-specific profiles and profiles switching at runtime.

### d. Event-Driven Lifecycle Hooks

* Add hooks for `on_start`, `on_stop`, `on_error`.
* Allow services to subscribe to application-wide events during registration.

---

## 3. Deep Application Integration

### a. Initialization in Application Startup

* Call `initialize()` during app startup.
* Automatically register core services such as database, event bus, configuration, etc.

### b. Graceful Shutdown

* Hook into application shutdown signals.
* Call `shutdown()` to dispose of services and clean resources properly.

### c. Middleware and Request Lifecycle

* Use scoped services within request handlers or background tasks.
* Create middleware or context managers that automatically instantiate and dispose of request-scoped dependencies.

### d. Auto-Discovery and Registration

* Scan modules or packages for service classes decorated with registration annotations.
* Register services automatically based on conventions or annotations.

### e. Testing and Mocking Support

* Provide mechanisms for replacing services with mocks or test doubles.
* Support environment-based registration for testing vs production.

## 4. Implementation Plan

| Step | Description                                      | Timeline  |
|------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| 1    | Add detailed logging, validation, and timing     | 1-2 weeks |
| 2    | Implement decorators and auto-registration       | 2-3 weeks |
| 3    | Extend scope management and lifecycle hooks      | 2 weeks   |
| 4    | Integrate with startup/shutdown hooks in the app | 1 week    |
| 5    | Develop auto-discovery and configuration loading | 3 weeks   |
| 6    | Write comprehensive documentation and examples   | 1-2 weeks |

## 5. Conclusion

By improving lifecycle management, adding flexible registration mechanisms, enabling auto-discovery, and integrating deeply into the application startup and shutdown
processes, UnoServiceProvider can evolve into a robust, modern dependency injection container. This will enhance configurability, testability, and maintainability for
large-scale, modular Python applications.

# Enhancing and Deeply Integrating UnoServiceProvider

This document outlines a systematic approach to evolve UnoServiceProvider into a robust, observable, and deeply integrated dependency injection container for your
application.

## 1. Fundamental Improvements

### a. Enhanced Logging

* Add detailed debug and info logs for every registration, resolution, initialization, and disposal.
* Log timing metrics for resolution and lifecycle events for performance insight.
* Log failures explicitly with context and stack traces.

### b. Validation & Consistency Checks

* Implement dependency graph validation before startup.
* Detect circular dependencies and missing services.
* Warn or error if re-registration attempts occur after startup.

### c. Lifecycle & Resource Management

* Support explicit lifecycle hooks such as `on_startup`, `on_shutdown`.
* Allow services to register cleanup functions or coroutines.
* Implement a robust shutdown sequence in reverse order.

## 2. Extending Functionality

### a. Decorator-based Registration

* Introduce decorators like `@singleton`, `@scoped`, `@transient` for intuitive service registration.
* Support auto-registration via module scanning and annotations.
* Register configuration objects automatically.

### b. Scoped Container Hierarchies

* Enable hierarchical scopes / nested containers for request, session, or background task lifetimes.
* Support named or tagged scopes for different application layers.
* Provide explicit scope disposal APIs.

### c. Configuration & Environment Support

* Load configurations automatically from environment variables, YAML/JSON files.
* Support profile switching (dev, staging, prod).
* Inject environment-specific dependencies dynamically.

### d. Event-driven Lifecycle Hooks

* Enable services to subscribe to app-wide events.
* Call hooks during startup, shutdown, error, and custom triggers.
* Support registration of event handlers with dependency injection.

## 3. Application Deep Integration

### a. Initialization

* Call `initialize()` during app startup, after setting up app context.
* Automatically register core services: database, config, event bus, logging.
* Detect and register optional components (vector search, reporting).

### b. Graceful Shutdown

* Hook into application shutdown signals.
* Call `shutdown()` to cleanly dispose of services, close database connections, flush logs.
* Support async cleanup tasks.

### c. Request/Task Lifecycle

* Use request-scoped containers for web APIs.
* Use async context managers to automatically instantiate/dispose per request.
* Inject scoped dependencies into handlers/middlewares.

### d. Auto-Discovery & Plugin Registration

* Scan modules/packages for domain-specific services.
* Auto-register classes based on annotations or naming conventions.
* Support plugin-based extensibility.

### e. Testing & Mocking

* Provide hooks or test-registration modes for mocks.
* Support replacing real services with fakes/stubs during tests.
* Ensure tests run with isolated container instances.
