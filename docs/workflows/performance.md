# Workflow Performance Optimization Guide

This guide provides strategies and best practices for optimizing the performance of your workflows, especially in high-volume environments.

## Understanding Workflow Performance

Workflow performance is influenced by several factors:

1. **Trigger Frequency**: How often workflows are initiated
2. **Condition Complexity**: How complex the condition evaluation logic is
3. **Action Execution**: Time taken to complete actions
4. **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, and database usage
5. **Concurrency**: Parallel execution capabilities

## Monitoring Workflow Performance

Before optimizing, establish baseline metrics:

### Key Performance Indicators

1. **Execution Time**: Total time from trigger to completion
2. **Condition Evaluation Time**: Time spent evaluating conditions
3. **Action Execution Time**: Time spent executing each action
4. **Database Query Time**: Time spent on database operations
5. **Execution Success Rate**: Percentage of successful executions
6. **Throughput**: Number of workflows processed per minute/hour

### Using Built-in Monitoring

The workflow system provides built-in performance monitoring:

1. **Execution History Dashboard**: Shows timing metrics for each workflow
2. **Execution Detail View**: Provides timing breakdown for each action
3. **System Health Dashboard**: Displays resource utilization and queue metrics

### Custom Performance Logging

For advanced monitoring, implement custom performance logging:

```python
# In your workflow service implementation
async def execute_workflow(workflow_id, context):
    start_time = time.time()
    
    # Record start of condition evaluation
    condition_start = time.time()
    condition_result = await evaluate_conditions(workflow_id, context)
    condition_time = time.time() - condition_start
    
    # Record action execution times
    action_times = []
    for action in workflow.actions:
        action_start = time.time()
        action_result = await execute_action(action, context)
        action_times.append({
            "action_id": action.id,
            "type": action.type,
            "execution_time": time.time() - action_start
        })
    
    total_time = time.time() - start_time
    
    # Log detailed performance metrics
    metrics.log_workflow_performance(
        workflow_id=workflow_id,
        total_execution_time=total_time,
        condition_evaluation_time=condition_time,
        action_execution_times=action_times,
        entity_type=context.entity_type,
        operation=context.operation
    )
    
    return result
```

## Optimizing Workflow Triggers

### Entity-Level Optimizations

1. **Selective Trigger Operations**:
   - Specify only the operations that should trigger the workflow
   - **Bad**: `"operations": ["create", "update", "delete"]` (triggers on all operations)
   - **Good**: `"operations": ["create"]` (triggers only on creation)

2. **Field-Specific Triggers**:
   - For update operations, specify which fields should trigger the workflow
   - **Bad**: Triggering on any field update
   - **Good**:
   ```json
   {
     "entity_type": "order",
     "operations": ["update"],
     "field_triggers": ["status", "payment_state"]
   }
   ```

3. **Consider Trigger Batching**:
   - For high-frequency entities, batch triggers to reduce execution frequency
   - Use a periodic scheduled workflow instead of per-entity triggers

### System-Level Optimizations

1. **Event Queue Configuration**:
   - Increase worker threads for parallel processing
   - Configure appropriate queue sizes to prevent memory issues
   - Implement backpressure handling for event surges

2. **Event Filtering**:
   - Add pre-filtering at the event source to reduce unnecessary triggers
   - Implement entity-level or tenant-level filtering early in the pipeline

## Optimizing Condition Evaluation

### Condition Structure

1. **Early Exit Strategy**:
   - Place most restrictive or fastest conditions first
   - **Bad**:
   ```json
   {
     "conditions": [
       { "type": "complex_database_query", "...": "..." },
       { "type": "field", "field": "status", "operator": "eq", "value": "active" }
     ]
   }
   ```
   - **Good**:
   ```json
   {
     "conditions": [
       { "type": "field", "field": "status", "operator": "eq", "value": "active" },
       { "type": "complex_database_query", "...": "..." }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Condition Complexity**:
   - Break complex composite conditions into simpler conditions
   - Use pre-computed fields for complex evaluations
   - Cache repeated condition results

### Condition Optimization Techniques

1. **Index Fields Used in Conditions**:
   - Ensure database fields used in conditions are properly indexed
   - Create composite indexes for commonly combined conditions

2. **Use Database Conditions Instead of Memory Evaluation**:
   - Let the database handle complex filtering when possible
   - **Bad**: Retrieving all records and filtering in memory
   - **Good**: Using database queries with appropriate WHERE clauses

3. **Implement Custom Condition Caching**:
   - Cache condition evaluation results for repeated patterns
   - Use time-based or entity-based cache invalidation

```python
class CachedConditionEvaluator(ConditionEvaluatorBase):
    """Condition evaluator with result caching."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = {}
        self.cache_ttl = 60  # seconds
    
    async def evaluate(self, condition, context):
        # Create a cache key from condition and relevant context data
        cache_key = self._create_cache_key(condition, context)
        
        # Check cache first
        cached_result = self._get_cached_result(cache_key)
        if cached_result is not None:
            return cached_result
        
        # Evaluate condition if not in cache
        result = await self._evaluate_condition(condition, context)
        
        # Store in cache
        self._cache_result(cache_key, result)
        
        return result
        
    def _create_cache_key(self, condition, context):
        # Create a cache key based on condition and entity data
        # Include only fields that affect the condition
        # ...
```

## Optimizing Action Execution

### Action Configuration

1. **Minimize Action Count**:
   - Combine similar actions where possible
   - Use templates to generate dynamic content in a single action
   - Use conditional actions to avoid unnecessary executions

2. **Optimize Database Actions**:
   - Use batch operations for multiple records
   - Limit fields in queries to only what's needed
   - Use appropriate indexes for database operations

3. **Optimize External Service Calls**:
   - Implement connection pooling for external services
   - Use timeouts to prevent hanging on slow responses
   - Implement circuit breakers for unreliable services

### Parallel Action Execution

1. **Enable Parallel Processing**:
   - Configure independent actions to execute in parallel
   - Use the `"execution_strategy"` setting:
   ```json
   {
     "workflow_settings": {
       "action_execution_strategy": "parallel",
       "max_parallel_actions": 5
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Action Dependencies**:
   - Explicitly define action dependencies for ordered execution
   - Actions without dependencies will execute in parallel

```json
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "id": "action1",
      "type": "database",
      "operation": "query",
      "result_variable": "data"
    },
    {
      "id": "action2",
      "type": "notification",
      "dependencies": ["action1"],
      "body": "Results: {{data.length}} items found"
    },
    {
      "id": "action3",
      "type": "webhook",
      "dependencies": ["action1"],
      "body": {"result_count": "{{data.length}}"}
    }
  ]
}
```

### Execution Buffering and Batching

1. **Notification Batching**:
   - Group notifications for the same recipient
   - Implement delivery windows for non-urgent notifications

2. **Email Delivery Optimization**:
   - Use delivery windows for bulk emails
   - Implement priority queues for different email types
   - Use transactional email services for reliable delivery

## Database Optimization

### Query Optimization

1. **Use Selective Queries**:
   - Retrieve only needed fields and records
   - **Bad**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM orders WHERE created_at > ?
   ```
   - **Good**:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, status, total FROM orders WHERE created_at > ? LIMIT 1000
   ```

2. **Indexing Strategy**:
   - Create indexes for fields used in workflow conditions
   - Create composite indexes for common query patterns
   - Monitor index usage and performance

### Connection Management

1. **Connection Pooling**:
   - Configure appropriate pool sizes based on workflow concurrency
   - Monitor connection usage and adjust as needed
   - Implement connection timeout handling

2. **Transaction Management**:
   - Use transactions appropriately for related operations
   - Keep transactions short-lived to avoid locks
   - Implement retry logic for transaction conflicts

## Template Rendering Optimization

### Efficient Templates

1. **Simplify Templates**:
   - Keep template logic minimal
   - Pre-compute complex values before rendering
   - Break complex templates into smaller, reusable parts

2. **Precompile Templates**:
   - Compile templates at workflow creation/update
   - Cache compiled templates for reuse

```python
class OptimizedTemplateRenderer:
    """Renderer with template compilation caching."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.template_cache = {}
    
    def render(self, template_string, context):
        # Get compiled template from cache or compile new
        compiled_template = self._get_compiled_template(template_string)
        
        # Render with context
        return compiled_template.render(context)
    
    def _get_compiled_template(self, template_string):
        if template_string in self.template_cache:
            return self.template_cache[template_string]
        
        # Compile template
        compiled = self.environment.from_string(template_string)
        self.template_cache[template_string] = compiled
        return compiled
```

### Reduce Template Context Size

1. **Minimize Context Data**:
   - Include only necessary data in template context
   - Filter large arrays before passing to templates
   - Use pagination for rendering large datasets

## Scaling Workflows

### Horizontal Scaling

1. **Worker Scaling**:
   - Deploy multiple workflow workers for processing
   - Distribute workers across servers for load balancing
   - Use auto-scaling based on queue size

2. **Database Scaling**:
   - Implement read replicas for query-heavy workflows
   - Consider sharding for very high-volume systems
   - Use connection pooling with appropriate limits

### Vertical Scaling

1. **Resource Allocation**:
   - Allocate appropriate CPU and memory to workflow services
   - Monitor resource utilization and adjust as needed
   - Configure garbage collection for optimal performance

### Tenant Isolation

1. **Multi-tenant Considerations**:
   - Implement workflow execution quotas per tenant
   - Isolate resource-intensive tenants
   - Monitor tenant-level metrics for bottlenecks

## High-Volume Entity Strategies

For entities with very high update frequency (e.g., IoT data, stock prices):

### Throttling and Sampling

1. **Event Throttling**:
   - Implement rate limiting at the event source
   - Configure maximum events per entity per time period
   - Use sliding window algorithms for smooth throttling

2. **Event Sampling**:
   - Process only a percentage of events for high-frequency entities
   - Implement intelligent sampling based on value changes
   - Use time-based triggers instead of per-update triggers

```python
class SampledEventProcessor:
    """Process only a sample of high-frequency events."""
    
    def __init__(self, sampling_rate=0.1, min_interval_seconds=60):
        self.sampling_rate = sampling_rate
        self.min_interval_seconds = min_interval_seconds
        self.last_processed = {}
    
    def should_process(self, entity_id, entity_type):
        current_time = time.time()
        
        # Check if we've processed this entity recently
        key = f"{entity_type}:{entity_id}"
        last_time = self.last_processed.get(key, 0)
        
        # Enforce minimum interval
        if current_time - last_time < self.min_interval_seconds:
            # If change is significant, process anyway
            if self._is_significant_change(entity_id, entity_type):
                self.last_processed[key] = current_time
                return True
            return False
        
        # Random sampling for high-frequency entities
        if random.random() <= self.sampling_rate:
            self.last_processed[key] = current_time
            return True
            
        return False
    
    def _is_significant_change(self, entity_id, entity_type):
        # Custom logic to detect significant changes
        # that should be processed regardless of sampling
        # ...
```

### Batch Processing

1. **Aggregation Workflows**:
   - Create specialized aggregation workflows for high-volume entities
   - Run at scheduled intervals instead of per-event
   - Process batches of events together

2. **Scheduled Summaries**:
   - Use scheduled workflows to generate periodic summaries
   - Store intermediate state to reduce processing load
   - Implement incremental processing for large datasets

## Advanced Performance Topics

### Custom Action Executor Optimization

Implement optimized action executors for performance-critical actions:

```python
class OptimizedNotificationExecutor(ActionExecutorBase):
    """Performance-optimized notification executor with batching."""
    
    def __init__(self, batch_size=100, max_delay_ms=500):
        self.batch_size = batch_size
        self.max_delay_ms = max_delay_ms
        self.pending_notifications = []
        self.batch_lock = asyncio.Lock()
        self.batch_task = None
    
    async def execute(self, action, context):
        # Extract notification details
        notification = self._create_notification(action, context)
        
        # For high-priority notifications, send immediately
        if notification.priority == "high":
            return await self._send_notification_immediately(notification)
        
        # For normal priority, consider batching
        async with self.batch_lock:
            self.pending_notifications.append(notification)
            
            # If batch is full, process immediately
            if len(self.pending_notifications) >= self.batch_size:
                await self._process_batch()
            elif self.batch_task is None:
                # Schedule delayed batch processing
                self.batch_task = asyncio.create_task(self._schedule_batch())
        
        return {"status": "queued", "batch_id": notification.batch_id}
    
    async def _schedule_batch(self):
        await asyncio.sleep(self.max_delay_ms / 1000)
        async with self.batch_lock:
            await self._process_batch()
            self.batch_task = None
    
    async def _process_batch(self):
        # Group notifications by recipient for efficiency
        recipient_groups = {}
        for notification in self.pending_notifications:
            for recipient in notification.recipients:
                if recipient not in recipient_groups:
                    recipient_groups[recipient] = []
                recipient_groups[recipient].append(notification)
        
        # Send batched notifications to each recipient
        for recipient, notifications in recipient_groups.items():
            await self._send_batched_notifications(recipient, notifications)
        
        # Clear the batch
        self.pending_notifications = []
```

### Memory Usage Optimization

Optimize memory usage for resource-intensive workflows:

```python
class MemoryOptimizedWorkflowService:
    """Memory-optimized workflow service implementation."""
    
    async def execute_workflow(self, workflow_id, context):
        # Load workflow definition with minimal data
        workflow = await self._load_workflow_minimal(workflow_id)
        
        # Only load necessary entity data
        entity_data = await self._load_entity_data_selective(
            context.entity_id, 
            context.entity_type,
            self._get_required_fields(workflow)
        )
        
        # Update context with selective data
        context.entity_data = entity_data
        
        # Stream processing for large datasets
        if self._is_large_dataset_workflow(workflow):
            return await self._execute_workflow_streamed(workflow, context)
        
        # Normal execution for standard workflows
        return await self._execute_workflow_standard(workflow, context)
    
    def _get_required_fields(self, workflow):
        """Extract only the entity fields needed by this workflow."""
        required_fields = set()
        
        # Analyze conditions for field dependencies
        for condition in workflow.conditions:
            if condition.type == "field":
                required_fields.add(condition.field)
        
        # Analyze actions for field dependencies
        for action in workflow.actions:
            # Parse template fields from various action properties
            if hasattr(action, "body"):
                template_fields = self._extract_template_fields(action.body)
                required_fields.update(template_fields)
            
            # Add more action-specific field extraction...
            
        return list(required_fields)
    
    async def _execute_workflow_streamed(self, workflow, context):
        """Stream processing for workflows with large data requirements."""
        # Implementation for processing large datasets in chunks
        # ...
```
