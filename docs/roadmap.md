# Uno Framework Modernization Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned enhancements and architectural improvements for the Uno framework.

## Completed

✅ **Domain-Driven Design**: Restructure the codebase around core domain concepts, with clear boundaries and a ubiquitous language.

✅ **Event-Driven Architecture**: Implement a robust event system for loose coupling of components, improved scalability, and better extensibility.

✅ **CQRS Pattern**: Separate command (write) and query (read) operations for improved performance, scalability, and better alignment with domain logic.

✅ **Service Layer**: Create a dedicated service layer to encapsulate business logic and application workflows.

✅ **API Integration Layer**: Develop a standardized approach for integrating with external services and APIs.

✅ **Advanced Authorization**: Build a more sophisticated authorization system with fine-grained permissions, role-based access control, and attribute-based policies.

✅ **Read Model Projections**: Implement specialized read models optimized for different query patterns.

✅ **Versioned API Management**: Create a system for managing API versions and changes over time.

✅ **Async-First Architecture**: Rearchitect core components to be asynchronous by default for improved performance and resource utilization.

✅ **Resource Management**: Implement a comprehensive resource management system for connections, clients, and other expensive resources.

✅ **Performance Optimization**: Identify and optimize performance bottlenecks in core components.

✅ **Error Handling Framework**: Develop a comprehensive error handling system with structured errors, error catalogs, and improved debugging capabilities.

✅ **Monitoring & Observability**: Create a monitoring system with metrics, tracing, health checks, and structured logging.

✅ **Documentation Generation**: Build a system for automatically generating comprehensive API documentation.

✅ **Schema Migration System**: Develop a robust schema migration system to manage database schema changes.

✅ **Plugin Architecture**: Create a plugin system to allow framework extension without modifying core code.

✅ **Multi-Tenant Support**: Add comprehensive support for multi-tenant applications.

✅ **Test Framework**: Build a comprehensive testing framework specific to Uno applications.

✅ **Deployment Pipeline**: Streamline the deployment process with CI/CD integration.

✅ **Security Enhancements**: Implement advanced security features including encryption, secure defaults, and security testing.

✅ **Caching Strategy**: Develop a comprehensive caching system for improved performance.

✅ **Real-time Updates**: Add WebSocket/SSE support for real-time data synchronization.

✅ **Offline Support**: Implement capabilities for offline operation and synchronization.
