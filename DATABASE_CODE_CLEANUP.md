# Database Provider Code Cleanup

This document outlines the cleanup of legacy database provider code across the UNO framework as part of Phase 1 of the implementation plan.

## Overview

The database cleanup effort focused on removing duplicate and inconsistent implementations of database access patterns. We consolidated database access into a single, unified `DatabaseProvider` implementation that conforms to the `DatabaseProviderProtocol` defined in the core protocols package.

## Changes Made

### 1. Deprecated Legacy Modules

The following modules were deprecated with warnings and replaced with re-exports from the new implementation:

- `uno.infrastructure.database.db` (UnoDB) → redirects to DatabaseProvider
- `uno.infrastructure.database.enhanced_db` (EnhancedDB) → redirects to DatabaseProvider
- `uno.infrastructure.database.enhanced_connection_pool` → redirects to ConnectionPool
- `uno.infrastructure.database.enhanced_pool_session` → deprecated with no re-export
- `uno.infrastructure.database.enhanced_session` → deprecated with no re-export
- `uno.infrastructure.database.pooled_session` → deprecated with no re-export

### 2. Updated Protocol Interfaces

- Created new, unified protocol interfaces in `uno.core.protocols.database`:
  - `DatabaseProviderProtocol`
  - `DatabaseConnectionProtocol`
  - `DatabaseSessionProtocol`
  - `ConnectionPoolProtocol`
  - `TransactionManagerProtocol`
  - `DatabaseManagerProtocol`
  - `QueryExecutorProtocol`

- Updated legacy interfaces in `uno.dependencies.interfaces` to issue deprecation warnings

### 3. Updated Dependency Utilities

- Updated `uno.dependencies.database` to use the new protocols
- Changed `get_db_session` and `get_raw_connection` to use DatabaseProviderProtocol
- Updated `get_repository` to use the RepositoryProtocol from core
- Updated `get_db_manager` to use DatabaseManagerProtocol
- Updated `get_sql_execution_service` to use QueryExecutorProtocol

## Implementation Details

### Database Provider Implementation

The new `DatabaseProvider` class:
- Supports both synchronous and asynchronous database access
- Provides connection pooling for efficient resource management
- Uses asyncpg for async connections and psycopg for sync connections
- Implements proper health checking and resource cleanup
- Follows the protocol-based design for easy mocking and testing

### Connection Pool Implementation

The new `ConnectionPool` class:
- Manages a pool of database connections
- Provides connection acquisition and release methods
- Implements connection health checks
- Tracks pool statistics like size and free connections
- Supports proper cleanup on application shutdown

## Backward Compatibility

To ensure a smooth transition:

1. Legacy modules issue deprecation warnings but continue to function
2. Legacy protocol interfaces redirect to the new interfaces
3. Helper functions continue to work with both old and new code

This approach allows for gradual migration of existing code without breaking changes.

## Next Steps

With the database provider implementation and cleanup complete, the next steps are:

1. Complete the protocol testing framework
2. Implement the Event Bus system
3. Implement the Unit of Work pattern

These components will integrate with the new database provider to create a cohesive data access and event management system.
