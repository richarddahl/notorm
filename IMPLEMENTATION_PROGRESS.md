## Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 2 implementation as detailed in PHASE2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md:
   - Week 1: Entity Framework and Value Objects
     - Implement EntityBase and AggregateRoot
     - Create ValueObject base class and specializations
     - Ensure compatibility with Phase 1 components
   
   - Week 2: Specifications, Repositories, and Domain Events
     - Implement Specification pattern
     - Create domain-specific repository implementations
     - Extend event system for domain needs

2. Optional Enhancements to consider:
   - Add PostgreSQL implementation of EventStore
   - Implement distributed Unit of Work
   - Create benchmarks for core components
   - Add event subscription management UI
