# Result Monad Refactoring Progress

## Objective
Modernize the codebase to use the Result monad pattern for error handling in all repositories and services, ensuring consistent error propagation, modern Python type annotations, and high code quality.

## Progress Log

### 2025-04-20

#### Audit Summary
- **repositories.py**: Fully compliant. All methods return `Result` types.
- **domain_services.py**: Fully compliant. Uses `Result` pattern.
- **domain_repositories.py**: Now compliant. All public methods refactored to return `Result` types.
- **aggregation.py**: Fully compliant. Public API uses `Result`, private helpers return raw types (acceptable).
- **dashboard.py**: API endpoints use HTTPException as allowed; simulated repo logic is documented for future Result usage.
- **api_integration.py**: Fully compliant. All endpoints use Result monad for service/repo calls and raise HTTPException at boundaries.
- **cli.py**: Compliant for CLI context (returns exit codes).
- **dtos.py**: Audited. All direct exceptions are within Pydantic model validators and are correct/required. No changes needed.
- **schemas.py**: Audited. No direct exceptions; all logic is DTO/entity conversion. Fully compliant, no changes needed.
- **entities.py**: Audited. No direct exceptions; all error handling via Result monad pattern. Fully compliant, no changes needed.
- **models.py**: Audited. No direct exceptions; all error handling is handled at the ORM/database level. Fully compliant, no changes needed.
- **errors.py**: Audited. No direct exceptions; all error handling is handled via error classes and registration. Fully compliant, no changes needed.
- **interfaces.py**: Audited. No direct exceptions; all error handling is via Result monad in interface signatures. Fully compliant, no changes needed.
- **repositories.py**: Audited. No direct exceptions; all error handling is via Result monad. Fully compliant, no changes needed.
- **sqlconfigs.py**: Audited. No direct exceptions; no error handling required. Fully compliant, no changes needed.
- **aggregation.py**: Audited. No direct exceptions; all error handling is via Result monad. Fully compliant, no changes needed.
- **api_integration.py**: Audited. Direct exceptions (raise HTTPException) are present, but only at the FastAPI API/controller layer for translating Result errors into HTTP responses. This is acceptable and expected for API modules.
- **dashboard.py**: Audited. Direct exceptions (raise HTTPException) are present, but only at the FastAPI API/controller layer for translating Result errors into HTTP responses. This is acceptable and expected for API modules.
- **dtos.py**: Audited. Only raises exceptions in Pydantic model validators, which is required and compliant with Pydantic's validation mechanism. No other direct exceptions.
- **cli.py**: Audited. No direct exceptions; fully compliant.
- **domain_repositories.py**: Audited. No direct exceptions; fully compliant.
- **domain_services.py**: Audited. No direct exceptions; fully compliant.

#### Next Steps
- [x] Audit `dtos.py` for any remaining direct exceptions in validation logic (ensure only Pydantic-required exceptions are raised). **Complete: All direct exceptions are correct in Pydantic validators.**
- [x] Audit `schemas.py` for direct exceptions and error handling. **Complete: No direct exceptions, fully compliant.**
- [x] Audit `entities.py` for direct exceptions and error handling. **Complete: No direct exceptions, all error handling via Result monad, fully compliant.**
- [x] Audit `models.py` for direct exceptions and error handling. **Complete: No direct exceptions, all error handling is handled at the ORM/database level, fully compliant.**
- [x] Audit `errors.py` for direct exceptions and error handling. **Complete: No direct exceptions, all error handling is handled via error classes and registration, fully compliant.**
- [x] Audit `interfaces.py` for direct exceptions and error handling. **Complete: No direct exceptions, all error handling is via Result monad in interface signatures, fully compliant.**
- [x] Audit `repositories.py` for direct exceptions and error handling. **Complete: No direct exceptions, all error handling is via Result monad, fully compliant.**
- [x] Audit `sqlconfigs.py` for direct exceptions and error handling. **Complete: No direct exceptions, no error handling required, fully compliant.**
- [x] Audit `aggregation.py` for direct exceptions and error handling. **Complete: No direct exceptions, all error handling is via Result monad, fully compliant.**
- [x] Audit all remaining infrastructure modules in the reports package. **Complete: All modules have been reviewed and are compliant with Result monad conventions, with exceptions only in API/controller and Pydantic validation layers where appropriate.**
- [ ] Continue with another package or address linting, tests, or documentation as needed.
- [ ] Ensure all Success/Failure calls use explicit type parameters and `convert=True` where needed.
- [ ] Document any complex cases or design decisions here.

---

## Current Task
**Refactor `domain_repositories.py` so all public methods return `Result` types.**

- [ ] Update method signatures to `Result[T, Exception]` or similar.
- [ ] Wrap all return values in `Success` or `Failure`.
- [ ] Add try/except blocks for error handling.
- [ ] Update type annotations to Python 3.10+ syntax.
- [ ] Add/expand docstrings to clarify Result-based error handling.
- [ ] Remove/replace any direct returns of raw types or None.

---

## Remaining Work
- [ ] Complete above steps for other modules as needed (see Next Steps).
- [ ] Final audit and run tests.

---

## Notes
- Private helper methods (underscore-prefixed) may return raw types if not part of the public API.
- API endpoints may raise exceptions at the boundary (per conventions).
- Pydantic validators (dtos.py) should use exceptions as required by Pydantic.
