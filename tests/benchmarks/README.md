# Performance Benchmarks

This directory contains benchmark files generated by the Uno Testing Framework's performance testing component.

Benchmarks are used to track performance metrics over time and detect performance regressions in the codebase.

## Usage

Benchmarks are automatically generated when running tests that use the `PerformanceTest` class or the `@benchmark` decorator from the `uno.testing.performance` module.

## Organization

Benchmark files are organized by module and test name, and stored in JSON format.

Example: `test_example_test_performance_method.benchmark.json`

## Interpreting Results

Each benchmark file contains:

- Current benchmark statistics (min, max, mean, median, standard deviation)
- Historical data for trend analysis
- Raw measurement results for detailed analysis

Performance regressions are automatically detected when the current performance is worse than the baseline by more than the specified multiplier (default: 1.2 or 20% slower).
