# Modernization Summary

This document summarizes the modernization efforts completed to make the Uno framework a showcase of modern Python development.

## Core Framework Modernization

### 1. Dependency Injection System

We implemented a comprehensive dependency injection system that replaces the legacy `inject` library:

- Created a modern `DIContainer` with singleton, scoped, and transient service lifetimes
- Implemented proper service scope management with disposable resources
- Added FastAPI integration for seamless DI in web applications
- Provided testing utilities for easy mocking and dependency substitution

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture 

We implemented a robust event system supporting:

- Event definition with proper metadata and context
- Synchronous and asynchronous event handling
- Prioritized event handlers
- Decorator-based handler registration
- Automatic handler discovery
- Event collection for batch processing

### 3. CQRS Pattern

We implemented a comprehensive CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) system:

- Command and query abstractions with strong typing
- Command bus and query bus for dispatching
- Mediator pattern for centralized handling
- Decorator-based handler registration
- Complete separation of read and write operations

### 4. Error Handling Framework

We implemented a structured error handling approach:

- Base `UnoError` with error codes and context
- Result pattern with `Success` and `Failure` types
- Contextual error information for better debugging
- Integration with structured logging

### 5. Protocol-Based Interfaces

We replaced abstract base classes with Protocol-based interfaces:

- Added strong type checking with runtime_checkable
- Implemented type guards for runtime type checking
- Used PEP 695 type parameter syntax (`class Repository[T_Entity, T_ID]`)
- Reduced circular dependencies through better module organization

### 6. Python 3.12+ Features

We fully leveraged modern Python features:

- Type parameter syntax for generics (PEP 695)
- Self type for returning self-references
- TypeGuards for runtime type narrowing
- Proper type hints throughout the codebase
- Pattern matching where appropriate

## Technical Improvements

### 1. Legacy Code Removal

We systematically removed legacy patterns and code:

- Removed all `inject` library usage
- Eliminated the singleton `get_instance()` pattern
- Updated the Result pattern to use modern conventions
- Removed circular imports and import-time side effects

### 2. Documentation

We improved documentation throughout the codebase:

- Added comprehensive docstrings with Args/Returns/Raises sections
- Created example files demonstrating usage patterns
- Updated project documentation with modernization progress
- Added type hints for better IDE support

### 3. Validation

We added a validation script that ensures all legacy patterns have been removed:

- Checks for banned imports
- Verifies no legacy class patterns remain
- Ensures the codebase follows modern Python practices

## Testing Improvements

We added comprehensive tests for all new functionality:

- Unit tests for DI system
- Unit tests for event system
- Unit tests for CQRS implementation
- Integration tests for real-world scenarios
