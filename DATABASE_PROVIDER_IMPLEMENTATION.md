# Database Provider Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the Database Provider as part of Phase 1 of the UNO Framework modernization project.

## Overview

The Database Provider is a core infrastructure component that provides a centralized access point for database connections, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous operations. It abstracts away the details of connection pooling, session management, and database-specific drivers.

## Implementation Details

The implementation includes the following components:

1. **Protocol Interfaces**
   - `DatabaseProviderProtocol`: The main interface for database providers
   - `DatabaseConnectionProtocol`: Interface for database connections
   - `DatabaseSessionProtocol`: Interface for ORM sessions
   - `ConnectionPoolProtocol`: Interface for connection pools
   - `TransactionManagerProtocol`: Interface for transaction management
   - `DatabaseManagerProtocol`: Interface for database administration
   - `QueryExecutorProtocol`: Interface for query execution

2. **Core Implementations**
   - `DatabaseProvider`: Implementation of the database provider that manages connections and sessions
   - `ConnectionPool`: Implementation of the connection pool for efficient resource management

3. **Factory Functions**
   - `create_database_provider`: A factory function for creating database providers

## Key Features

### 1. Connection Management

The database provider manages both sync and async connections to the database, using `asyncpg` for async operations and `psycopg` for sync operations. Connections are pooled and reused for efficiency.

```python
# Async connection example
async with database_provider.async_connection() as conn:
    result = await conn.fetch("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1", user_id)

# Sync connection example
with database_provider.sync_connection() as conn:
    result = conn.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s", (user_id,))
```

### 2. Session Management

The database provider provides ORM sessions for working with SQLAlchemy, supporting both sync and async workflows.

```python
# Async session example
async with database_provider.async_session() as session:
    result = await session.execute(select(User).where(User.id == user_id))
    user = result.scalar_one_or_none()

# Sync session example
with database_provider.sync_session() as session:
    user = session.query(User).filter(User.id == user_id).first()
```

### 3. Connection Pooling

The connection pool manages connections efficiently, handling connection acquisition, release, and health monitoring.

```python
# Get a connection from the pool
conn = await pool.acquire()
try:
    await conn.execute("INSERT INTO logs (message) VALUES ($1)", "Operation completed")
finally:
    await pool.release(conn)
```

### 4. Health Checks

Database providers include health check mechanisms to verify database connectivity, which is essential for monitoring and failover.

```python
# Check database health
is_healthy = await database_provider.health_check()
if not is_healthy:
    logger.error("Database is not responding!")
```

### 5. Configuration Management

Database configuration is handled through a strongly-typed `ConnectionConfig` class, with validation using the new validation framework.

```python
# Create a database provider with custom configuration
config = ConnectionConfig(
    db_host="localhost",
    db_port=5432,
    db_role="app_user",
    db_name="app_db",
    db_user_pw="secure_password",
    pool_size=10
)
provider = create_database_provider(config)
```

## Integration with the Validation Framework

The Database Provider implementation leverages the validation framework for configuration validation, demonstrating how the components of Phase 1 work together:

```python
# Create config from dictionary with validation
validate = validate_schema(ConnectionConfig)
result = validate(config_dict)

if result.is_failure:
    # Handle validation errors
    error_message = "Invalid database configuration: "
    error_details = ", ".join(f"{e.path}: {e.message}" for e in result.errors)
    raise ValueError(f"{error_message}{error_details}")

config = result.value
```

## Backward Compatibility

To ensure a smooth transition, we've added backward compatibility for legacy code:

1. The old `UnoDatabaseProviderProtocol` in `uno.dependencies.interfaces` has been updated to issue deprecation warnings and redirect to the new protocol.
2. Similarly, `UnoDBManagerProtocol` now points to the new `DatabaseManagerProtocol`.
3. The protocol interfaces include an alias `UnoDatabaseProviderProtocol = DatabaseProviderProtocol` for backward compatibility.

## Next Steps

The next steps in Phase 1 are:

1. **Enhance Connection Pooling**: Implement advanced features like connection validation, reconnection, and more sophisticated health checks.
2. **Implement Transaction Management**: Create a `TransactionManager` implementation that supports nested transactions and savepoints.
3. **Database Migrations**: Integrate with the migration system for schema management.
4. **Event Bus Integration**: Connect the database operations with the event system for event sourcing.
5. **Unit of Work Pattern**: Implement the Unit of Work pattern for coordinating operations and transactions.
