 Based on my examination of the code, here's an overview of the attributes and values modules in the Uno framework:

  Attributes Module

  The attributes module provides a flexible system for defining and associating attributes with various objects in the system, similar to a dynamic property system.

  Key Components:

  1. AttributeType:
    - Defines types of attributes that can be associated with objects
    - Includes metadata like name, text, requirements, and display options
    - Can form hierarchies with parent-child relationships
    - Can specify which object types (meta_types) can have this attribute
    - Can limit value types using queries
  2. Attribute:
    - Represents a specific instance of an attribute type applied to an object
    - Contains values and optional comments
    - Can have multiple values if allowed by the attribute type
    - Can require follow-up actions
  3. Relationships:
    - Attributes can be associated with MetaRecord objects
    - AttributeTypes can describe specific MetaType objects
    - Values can be associated with attributes through many-to-many relationships

  Values Module

  The values module provides a type-safe system for storing different types of values that can be used throughout the system, particularly as attribute values.

  Key Components:

  1. Value Types:
    - BooleanValue: True/False values
    - DateTimeValue: Date and time values
    - DateValue: Date values
    - DecimalValue: Decimal number values
    - IntegerValue: Integer values
    - TextValue: Text string values
    - TimeValue: Time of day values
    - Attachment: File attachments with paths and names
  2. Common Features:
    - Each value type has a corresponding model and object class
    - Each includes a "lookups" field that defines permitted lookup operations
    - Values have tenant-specific uniqueness constraints
    - All value types inherit from DefaultObjectMixin for standard functionality

  Integration Between Modules

  The attributes and values modules work together to provide a flexible dynamic property system:

  1. Attribute to Value Association:
    - Attributes can have multiple values through many-to-many relationships
    - The attribute type can specify which value types are allowed
  2. Querying:
    - The system supports queries that can filter objects based on their attributes
    - Queries can use different lookup operations depending on the value type
  3. Metadata Integration:
    - Both modules integrate with the meta module for type information
    - AttributeTypes can reference QueryModels to limit applicability

  Key Features and Capabilities

  1. Dynamic Schema Extension:
    - Allows adding custom attributes to objects without modifying database schemas
    - Supports type-safe value storage with appropriate validations
  2. Flexible Relationships:
    - Attributes can form hierarchies through parent-child relationships
    - Values can be shared across attributes
  3. Business Rules:
    - Attribute types can enforce rules like required values, comments, etc.
    - Query-based filtering can limit which objects can have which attributes
  4. Type Safety:
    - Different value types ensure appropriate storage and validation
    - Lookup operations are tailored to each value type

  This system provides a powerful way to extend the data model dynamically while maintaining type safety and enforcing business rules. It's especially useful for user-defined attributes that vary by tenant or application domain.
