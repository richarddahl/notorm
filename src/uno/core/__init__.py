"""
Core Module

This module contains the core abstractions and utilities that form the foundation
of the UNO framework architecture. It defines the protocols, base classes, and
common utilities used throughout the system.

The core module is the most stable and foundational layer, with minimal dependencies
on external packages. All other modules in the system depend on the core, but the
core should not depend on them.
