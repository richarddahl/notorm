# API Endpoint Migration Issues and Remediation Plan

## Overview
The codebase is currently undergoing a migration of its API endpoint framework. This process has introduced inconsistencies and technical debt across the API layer. This document identifies the issues, provides examples, and outlines a detailed remediation plan to achieve a unified, maintainable, and testable API architecture.

---

## 1. Issues Identified

### 1.1. Multiple API Integration Patterns
- **Legacy Pattern**: Some modules define endpoints directly in `api.py` or `admin/api.py` files using FastAPI `APIRouter` and manual registration.
- **Modular Pattern**: Other modules use `api_integration.py` files with registration functions (e.g., `register_jobs_endpoints`, `register_workflow_endpoints`) that encapsulate endpoint registration logic.
- **Domain-driven Pattern**: Some value/domain modules use factories or adapters (e.g., `UnoEndpointFactory`, `RepositoryAdapter`) to auto-generate endpoints from repositories/services.
- **Router Registration**: Inconsistent use of routers, prefixes, tags, and dependency injection patterns.

### 1.2. Inconsistent Path Prefixes and Versioning
- Some endpoints use `/api/v1`, others use `/jobs`, `/workflows`, `/meta`, etc., without a unified versioning or prefixing scheme.
- Lack of a single source of truth for API versioning and base path configuration.

### 1.3. Dependency Injection and Service Resolution
- Some endpoints resolve dependencies via the DI container, others instantiate services directly or use ad hoc provider functions.
- Inconsistent use of FastAPI's `Depends` and custom DI wrappers (see `core/di/fastapi.py`).

### 1.4. Documentation and OpenAPI Inconsistencies
- Some modules use advanced OpenAPI utilities (see `api/endpoint/openapi.py`), others rely on FastAPI defaults.
- Tags, summaries, and descriptions are inconsistently applied.
- Security schemes and response examples are not uniformly documented.

### 1.5. Middleware and Resource Management
- Resource management, health endpoints, and middleware are sometimes registered in `core/fastapi_integration.py` and sometimes not used at all.
- Health checks and management endpoints are inconsistently available.

### 1.6. Redundant or Legacy Files
- Legacy files (e.g., `api.py`, `apidef.py`, `domain_api_integration.py`) may duplicate logic or provide overlapping endpoints with new integration modules.
- Some modules have both `api.py` and `api_integration.py`, leading to confusion.

---

## 2. Remediation Plan

### 2.1. Adopt a Unified API Integration Pattern
- **Standardize on `api_integration.py`** for each module as the entry point for endpoint registration.
- All endpoint registration should occur via explicit `register_*_endpoints` functions that accept a FastAPI app or router, path prefix, dependencies, and service overrides.
- Remove or refactor legacy `api.py` and `admin/api.py` files to delegate to the new integration modules.

### 2.2. Centralize Path Prefixing and Versioning
- Define a single source of truth for API base path and version (e.g., `/api/v1`) in a shared configuration module.
- Ensure all endpoint registration functions accept and use this prefix.
- Update all routers and endpoint registration to use consistent prefixes and tags.

### 2.3. Standardize Dependency Injection
- Require all endpoints to resolve dependencies via the DI container, using FastAPI's `Depends` or the project's DI wrappers (see `core/di/fastapi.py`).
- Remove direct instantiation of services from endpoints.
- Refactor provider functions to use the DI container.

### 2.4. Unify OpenAPI Documentation
- Require all modules to use the enhanced OpenAPI utilities (see `api/endpoint/openapi.py`) for documenting endpoints, responses, and security.
- Standardize use of tags, operation summaries, and response models.
- Document authentication and error responses for all endpoints.

### 2.5. Middleware and Health Endpoints
- Ensure resource management middleware and health endpoints are registered in the main FastAPI app for all environments.
- Remove redundant or inconsistent health routes from module-level routers.

### 2.6. Remove Redundant or Legacy Files
- Audit and remove (or refactor) legacy `api.py`, `apidef.py`, and `domain_api_integration.py` files.
- Ensure all endpoint registration flows through a single, well-documented integration module per domain.

### 2.7. Documentation and Developer Guidance
- Update developer documentation to describe the unified API integration pattern.
- Provide code examples and templates for registering new endpoints.
- Document how to add new modules and endpoints following the new pattern.

## 3. Migration Steps

1. **Inventory all API endpoint files** and document their registration patterns.
2. **Refactor each module** to use a single `api_integration.py` with explicit registration functions.
3. **Remove or delegate legacy files** to the new integration modules.
4. **Update path prefixes and versioning** to use the centralized configuration.
5. **Refactor dependency resolution** to use DI everywhere.
6. **Standardize OpenAPI documentation** and security schemes.
7. **Register middleware and health endpoints** in the main app.
8. **Update documentation and onboarding guides**.

## 5. Example: Unified API Integration Pattern

```python
# Example: src/uno/application/jobs/api_integration.py

def register_jobs_endpoints(
    app_or_router: Union[FastAPI, APIRouter],
    path_prefix: str = "/api/v1",
    dependencies: List[Any] = None,
    include_auth: bool = True,
    job_manager_service: Optional[JobManagerServiceProtocol] = None,
    task_registry_service: Optional[TaskRegistryProtocol] = None,
) -> Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Register all jobs-related API endpoints."""
    if dependencies is None:
        dependencies = []
    router = APIRouter()
    endpoints = register_all_job_endpoints(router, dependencies=dependencies)
    app_or_router.include_router(router, prefix=path_prefix)
    return endpoints
```
